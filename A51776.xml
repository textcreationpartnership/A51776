            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Kingdoms of <hi>Great Britain</hi> being United under the Dominion of one Prince, and the Animoſities and Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which uſually diſorder Neighbour-Nations, thereby removed; gave a ſudden Riſe to a very great and formidable Power, which could not be deſtroyed but by it ſelf. The Moderator of this vaſt Empire, was <hi>JAMES</hi> VI. King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Firſt Monarch of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Heir to both, as well by Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, from <hi>Margaret</hi> the only Daughter of <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> the laſt of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes, as by that of Force, derived to him from the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. This Wiſe and Learned Prince,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Charles</hi> I. ſucceeds to the Crown.</note> being gathered to his Fathers, the loſs which his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſuffered by it, however great, was abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repaired by the Succeſſion of his Son <hi>CHARLES;</hi> who being truly Heir to his Father's Greatneſs and Vertues, as well as Scepters, did excel all his Predeceſſors, in the more ſevere Diſquiſition of what was <hi>Fit</hi> and <hi>Juſt;</hi> ſo that our Tragedies will ſcarce find Credit with Poſterity, whilſt the Ages to come, miſtruſting the Reports of ſuch enormous Villainies, will look upon our unheard-of Viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes, but as the Fancies of Poetry, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration of Theatres. For, how is it poſſible to believe, that the <hi>Beſt</hi> of Princes ſhould meet with the <hi>Worſt</hi> of Subjects, on whom he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred more Graces, than the whole Series of his Anceſtors? and that he, who valued his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Life, at a lower Rate than the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his People, ſhould by a Judicial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide, be ſacrificed to the ambitious Violence of a prevailing Faction in their Repreſentative: and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97792:9"/>that, under the pretence of Uſurpation and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny? But theſe things happened, an everlaſting Reproach to the Nation, and not to be atoned for by any Reſentment, or Hecatombs of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>James</hi> left a flouriſhing Kingdom behind him, but an empty Treaſury, and his Succeſſor engaged in a War with <hi>Spain;</hi> and, what was worſe, the <hi>Parliament</hi> that oblig'd the Father to Arm, abandoned the Son, when they had expoſed him. Nor were the ſucceeding <hi>Parliaments</hi> more Obſequious, or forward in ſupplying his Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, how great ſoever; either in recovering the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or reſcuing the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> though undertaken in Defence of the Reformed Religion. 'Tis true, his Third <hi>Parliament</hi> voted him Five <hi>Subſidies;</hi> but we muſt own alſo,<note place="margin">The Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Right</note> that the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> being a Condeſcenſion even to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation, deſerv'd their beſt Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for, raiſed with that Grant, they, that very Seſſion, queſtioned the Tribute of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> though perpetually enjoyed by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, Kings of <hi>England;</hi> affirming; That he had reſigned what Right he could pretend to it, by that very Conceſſion; which they urged with ſo much Violence, that forgeting the Rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, the King was forced to Diſſolve them, and to puniſh ſome of the moſt Factious of that Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Convention.</p>
                        <p>But the Cauſes of theſe Heats muſt be further ſought. In the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> a great Number of People withdrew themſelves out of <hi>England,</hi> whereof many,<note place="margin">Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> infected with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>Geneva,</hi> upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Aſſumption to the Crown, returning, brought that uneaſie Preciſeneſs with them, which ſuddenly grew to that height, by the Carleſſneſs, or Puſillanimity of the Magiſtrates, under King <hi>James;</hi> that it did
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97792:10"/>not only inſinuate it ſelf, under the veil of Piety, amongſt the People, but even into the Court, and <hi>Parliaments;</hi> where joining it ſelf to thoſe of Anti-Monarchic Principles, it endeavoured to diminiſh the Prerogative, and ſubject the King to thoſe Neceſſities which might force him to unuſual Ways of ſupplying them: Which alſo happened; for, being preſſed by the indiſpenſible Exigence of his Affairs, and perceiving no hopes of Subſidies from Parliaments, he began to have an Averſion for them ſo Conſtituted, and ſearch for Refuge in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</hi> And yet he had ſo much Reverence for the Laws, that he would act nothing contrary to them, as appears in <hi>Ship-Money;</hi> which Tax how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were impoſed to vindicate the Honour of the Sea againſt Pyrates, and our Potent Neighbours, he would not exact it, till it was adjudged to him by all the Judges of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and that under their Hands. But the Common People deſpiſing the Moderation of their Prince, and inſtigated by thoſe who deſired a Change, crying out, That their Laws and Liberties were endangered, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; attributing all the Errors and Misfortunes in the Government (for the Undertakings Abroad had not been very ſucceſsful) to his Counſellors, that they might tranſverſly ſmite him, and blaſt his Reputation. To this the exuberant Power of the Clergy, that pretended Exemption from the Juriſdiction of the Laicks, did not pleaſe. The unuſual Introduction of Ceremonies, as they cried out, and the placing of the Communion-Table at the Eaſt-End of the Church, with the more ſevere Impoſition of Rites, however indifferent (except in the Command) did trouble them, and were the occaſion of very great Tumults in many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes. But nothing did equally move their Choler, and Pity, as the Puniſhment of ſome Seditious Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers againſt Ceremonies, and the Biſhops their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97792:10"/>Authors, by Incarceration, and cutting off their Ears; who, however Guilty, and deſerving what the Rigour of Juſtice could inflict, were yet thought to be hardly dealt with, conſidering the ſerene Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of thoſe Halcion Days. And truly, Peace, and its Concomitant, Plenty, flouriſh'd amongſt us, to the Envy of our Neighbours, continuing to the Fourth Luſtre of the King's Reign;<note place="margin">The Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Nation.</note> which might have been perpetual, being inexpugnable from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, if it had not been deſtroyed, by the more than Civil Rage of our Miſchievous Diſſenters. Nothing ſeemed wanting to our Felicity, before it was diſturbed by theſe nefarious Tumults; and, our People, if they could have ſeen their own Happineſs, were, conſidering the inexhauſtible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of all Things, the Liberty of Commerce, and the free Enjoyment of what they had acquired, the happieſt of any Subjects, under any known Government in the World. But our Luxury en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing with our Abundance, we grew wanton, and fell into ſuch a Surfeit, that nothing but a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Bleeding could effect a Cure. The true Cauſe of theſe Evils, had its Riſe from the noxious Indulgence of our Phyſicians, who neglecting to ſtifle the Factious Humours of the Puritans in their Infancy, gave ſuch force and boldneſs to this Contagion, that it unhappily Infected the whole Body Politick, to the Ruine of <hi>Hierarchy, the beſt of Spiritual, and Monarchy, the beſt of Temporal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis ſcarce conceivable, that there were found any in ſo happy a State, that ſhould ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a Change. And yet ſuch there were; amongſt which,<note place="margin">Who they were who deſired a Change.</note> the chief Ring-leaders were the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who had their Miſſionaries and Lecturers in all the Quarters of the Kingdom; and thoſe ſwarms of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> their Brood, who contended for an equal Liberty in Civil, as well as Sacred Things.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97792:11"/>The Catholicks wiſhed for the Dominion of <hi>Rome</hi> in Spirituals. But the Gentry, and Leſſer Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which compoſed the Houſe of Commons, out of Contemplation of their own Greatneſs whilſt they ſate there, preferred Democracy before all other. In the mean time, this diſguiſed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety grew up, under the plauſible pretence of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, ſeducing the Vulgar with a Shew of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, into a Reverence of it. It is not imaginable how far this Sacred <hi>Novelty</hi> prevailed, by the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Fury of its Preachers, and their uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed railing againſt the received Rites of the Church, and the lawful Power of the King. It had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd the Town, the Country, and Private Families into an Opinion of it; nor were the great Repreſentatives of the Kingdom, exempted from its Contagion, which the King had abundantly Experimented in all the Parliaments he had ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned: For in them the Novelliſts, and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticks, pretending the Liberty and Defence of Religion, againſt the Deſigns of the Court, and Popery, oppreſſed the Prerogative to advance their own; endeavouring to raiſe the Authority of the People, whoſe Vicegerents they were, upon the Ruines of the King. To this, they branded with the Odious Title of Papiſts, all that oppoſed them, by which means they deceived the People, who are ſtill the more addicted to their Superiors, by how much they obſerve them the more Zealous for the Advancement of Religion. And truly, the depravedneſs of the Age was ſo great, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was ſaid in behalf of the King and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters againſt Popery, had no Credit; but on the contrary, whatever was affirmed, to perſwade the People, that the Court did Favour Superſtition, was greedily ſwallowed down without any regard to Reaſons of State, which ſometimes obliged to a Compliance with the Deſires of Foreign Princes and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97792:11"/>Embaſſadors. But the true Source of our Miſeries came from <hi>Scotland;</hi> this Embryo of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Strength from Foreigners, upon this Occaſion.</p>
                        <p>The Nobility in the Infancy of King <hi>JAMES,</hi> had, by the Connivance of <hi>Murrey</hi> the Governour,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> Tumults.</note> uſurped the Lands and Poſſeſſions belonging to the Cathedrals and Monaſteries of that Kingdom; which they alſo enjoyed, untill <hi>King Charles,</hi> preſſed with foreign Wars, and but ill ſupplied from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> reſolved, by the Advice of his Council there, to reunite the ſaid Poſſeſſions to the Crown again; which he did by an Act of Revocation, with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Surrend'ries of Superiorities and Tithes. But thoſe Nobles reſolved to turn all upſide down, rather than part with their Uſurpations, and be deprived of the Vaſſalage of the Miniſters, and Land-owners. And ſo conſpiring againſt the King himſelf, deſigned to oppoſe his Authority, both Sacred and Civil, in the next <hi>Parliament</hi> he ſhould call. Moreover, there were ſome other Malecontents, who by reaſon of their Diſaffection, had been denied ſuch Titles and Honours, as they pretended to at his Majeſties Coronation, who all joyned together; and becauſe there are no Pretences more ſpecious than thoſe of Religion, nor more charming Bates to enſnare the Vulgar, it was thought moſt proper to be inſiſted on. Nor was it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Depravedneſs of the times, furniſhed them with Opportunities to manifeſt their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>The pious King was pleaſed to ſend the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and Book of Common-Prayers, ſigned with the Blood of the firſt Reformers of our Church,<note place="margin">The King ſends the <hi>Liturgy</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                           </note> to the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for he deſired, to unite in the ſame Opinion in Spirituals, thoſe People who were ſubject to the ſame Empire in Temporals. King <hi>JAMES</hi> had formerly propoſed the ſame thing to his Countrymen at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> who willingly aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97792:12"/>to it; and having framed it there, and adapted it to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was ſent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where it lay; till by the Advice of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and perſwaſion of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nearer him, though very unſeaſonably, his Majeſty returned it to them, with Command to have it uſed in all the <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chapels</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> This Advice, however laudable, was ill timed, for the growing Factions took thence an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to rebel; and 'tis ſcarce credible, with what contumacious Fury the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> (who would ſooner ſin againſt Religion its ſelf than its Rites) did oppoſe it; crying out, <hi>that the King intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Superſtition, and prophane Forms of Worſhip into the Church.</hi> Rumours were alſo ſpread abroad by the diſſatisfied Nobles before-mentioned, who abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing equal with the Reſtitution of what they had uſurped; as alſo by others of the Cabal, who longed for a Change, of reducing <hi>Scotland</hi> into a Province: So that the People thinking their Civil as well as Sacred Liberty were in danger, became obnoxious to the Artifices of every Faction. And this occaſioned the Sedition of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and the zealous Madneſs of the Rabble againſt the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</hi>

                        <p>The factious were not diſpleaſed with the King's Neceſſities,<note place="margin">The King's Neceſſities.</note> which they themſelves did from time to time contribute to, ſince there were no Subſidies to be obtained, but upon Conditions ruinous to Monarchy it ſelf; or by expoſing his beſt Friends and Miniſters, to their Rage and Slaughter.

The <hi>Scots</hi> being highly moved with this denial, produced an Inſtrument ſubſcribed with moſt of their Hands, which ſtrangely ſurpriſed them; until, upon a ſtrict ſcrutiny, they found it to be an Invention of the Lord <hi>Savil</hi>'s, who had really ſent them the ſaid Invitation, counterfeiting the ſubſigned Hands; which being now diſcovered by his own Confeſſion, it was thought fit, ſeeing the Cheat had ſucceeded ſo well, not to publiſh it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Strafford</hi> alone did dare to adviſe againſt this ſordid Compliance with the Enemy, urging, That the <hi>Scots</hi> were to be forced back with Steel, not Gold.

                           </note> for he had ſcarce taken his Seat in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> but he was accuſed by the <hi>Commons</hi> of High-Treaſon. And yet; there were ſome Motions made in order to his Preſervation, in Caſe the King would conſent to advance ſome of the Grandees of the Faction, to the great Offices of the Crown. But That being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, or denied, did ſo incenſe the Diſappointed, that, joining with the <hi>Scots,</hi> they became more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable againſt him.</p>
                        <p>The Articles againſt this Great Man, were Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-eight in Number; whereof the chief were, <hi>That he had Subverted the Fundamental Laws of the Land, Introduced a Deſpotick Power into the Kingdom, and endeavoured to deſtroy the Ancient Privileges of Parliament.</hi> To theſe, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Memorials were produced, wherein the Opinions of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and ſome others, given in Private to the King, were ſet down; which, as they added Weight to the Accuſation, ſo they added Infamy and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the <hi>Secretary,</hi> which he could not clear himſelf of, by pretending, his Son had ſtollen his Notes out of his Cloſet. But nothing of theſe were lawfully proved; although they had invited Witneſſes and Accuſers out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> too prone of their own accord to deſtroy this Great Man; that he being removed, they might attempt that Rebellion which they had long deſigned. For, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Arguments produced againſt him, the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> began to conceive, that if they did not deſtroy him, they ſhould hazard their own Reputation, eſpecially ſeeing the King had declared, in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Speech to the Two Houſes, <hi>That he could
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97792:17"/>not apprehend him Guilty;</hi> and that it was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Lords would alſo acquit him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore incenſed againſt him, they reſolved to deſtroy him, Voting him, by a Special Bill of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder,</hi> Guilty of High-Treaſon; for that he had endeavoured to infringe the Laws, and had by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulative Crimes, rend'red himſelf more than ſufficiently obnoxious; thereby, making themſelves his Accuſers and Judges. And, thus he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, by a New Law, made ſince his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: <hi>For Crimes not yet perpetrated: Not for the Ill he had already committed, but that he had enabled himſelf to do what he pleaſed.</hi> But they wiſely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that this ſhould not be made a Preſident, whereby they might ſecure themſelves againſt that Retribution of Injuſtice, which they had uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. By this they plainly acknowledged, the Injuriouſneſs of their Sentence; for had it been otherwiſe,<note place="margin">He is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> what harm could there have been in the Example? Whilſt they were thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the Tumults without, fomented by the Chief of the Conſpiracy, raged horribly, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally againſt their Diſſenting Colleagues, whereof Fifty-nine had their Names poſted up for <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordians;</hi> that is, Publick Enemies; that thereby they might be expoſed to the Madneſs of the Rabble: Though, in truth, they deſerved to have their Names inſerted in Gold, for daring ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to aſſert oppreſſed Innocence. Of theſe, the <hi>Lord Digby</hi> was one, who had been as ſevere as any in the Proſecution of the Earl, till convinced of his Error, by the Luſtre of the others Vertue, he generouſly recanted; whereby he loſt himſelf in the Opinion of the <hi>Faction,</hi> particularly by that admirable Speech which he made in the Houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paſſing that Fatal Bill.</p>
                        <p>The incenſed Multitude flew to that height of Violence, that, amongſt other Inſolences, they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97792:17"/>did dare to aſſault the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador's</hi> Houſe, upon Pretence of his ſhelt'ring of <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and, certainly he had run great hazard of being forced, if he had not been timely reſcued from their Fury, by the then Lord Mayor; inſomuch, that he did not doubt to queſtion, whether they were a Civilized People or not, ſeeing they ſo barbarouſly violated the Law of Nations. The <hi>Lord's Houſe</hi> enforced by the Tumults, did alſo, after much Reluctancy, aſſent to the Bill of Attainder, not conſidering, that their Authority would ſink with the King's, ſeeing it was not probable, that theſe Men would ſpoil the Crown, to adorn the Nobles. But the King himſelf ſatisfied of the Innocence of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, reſiſted longer, ſlighting the Uproars of the Populace, who, by Inſtigation of the Factions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually cryed out for Juſtice. Neither did he much value the Opinion of the <hi>Judges,</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance being occaſioned by their Fears; againſt whom he alſo complained, That inſtead of eaſing him of his Doubts, they amuſed him by their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Anſwers. The <hi>Biſhops</hi> alſo, who were to ſatisfie his Scruples in point of Conſcience, ſeemed to refer him to the Judges, ſave only, that Doctor <hi>Juxton,</hi> the then <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> had told him, <hi>That he ſhould do nothing againſt the Dictates of his Conſcience, upon any Conſideration in the World:</hi> Which he afterwards remembred, to the great Honour of that Excellent Prelate. Nor did he comply with the Fears of his Friends and Family, until over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not perſwaded, by the Earl's own Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and Letters; who deſired it, out of Hopes his Death might ſatisfie theſe Blood-thirſty Men, and atone betwixt the King and his People.<note place="margin">murthered, and</note> He then, however unwillingly, ſubſcribed; though by a Candour not to be imitated, he did all his Life after, as alſo at his Death, blame this too eaſie Aſſent, even in himſelf. In the mean time, he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97792:18"/>would make one Attempt more; in order to which, he wrote a Letter to the Lords, all with his own Hand; which he alſo ſent by his own Son, the Prince; wherein he deſired, <hi>That, ſeeing he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Juſtice of the Parliament, his Clemency might alſo take Place;</hi> which ſome affirm, was promiſed before he Signed the Bill, but that was but to extort it by any means; for now they tell him, by a Deputation of Twelve of their <hi>Houſe, That it could not be done, without the extream Peril of the Royal Family.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">lamented by the King.</note> He will however ſolemnize his Obſequies with Tears; for, when the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> gave him an Account of the <hi>Exit</hi> of this Illuſtrious Innocent; adding, <hi>That he had never ſeen ſo white a Soul reſtored to its Creator,</hi> he could not forbear weeping. And, thus fell this Great Perſon, being then alſo <hi>Lord Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Second to none for Wiſdom, Loyalty, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind; and who, as the King affirmed in his <hi>Divine Soliloquies, was a Gentleman, whoſe great Abilities might make a Prince rather afraid, than aſhamed, to employ him in the greateſt Affairs of State.</hi> He fell, as is ſaid, by a Decree, <hi>à poſt facto,</hi> but ſhall riſe again, by a <hi>Poſthume</hi> Law, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; he being then by a more Righteous Parliament, reſtored alſo to the Glories of his Honour and Innocence.</p>
                        <p>Nor was it by this Act only that the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his own Ruine, by removing ſo Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Servant, and ſo firm a Pillar of the State, but he alſo gave his Conſent to that of <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of this Parliament,<note place="margin">The Act of <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
                           </note> during the Pleaſure of <hi>both Houſes;</hi> depriving himſelf, by this Fatal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, of one of the Principal Flowers of his Crown, which was, the Diſpoſal of the Meeting, Proroguing, and Diſſolving of theſe Conventions at his Pleaſure. For, this ſignal and unuſual. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his, was abuſed to that height by theſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97792:18"/>moſt Ungrateful of Men, that they took occaſion hence, not only to ruine their Benefactor, but wholly to ſubvert the Government; which they alſo effected.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had been already Impeached, and was now cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Tower.</hi> And ſeeing he was the Chief Pillar of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as appears in his Admirable Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> the Jeſuit; and he having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Two and Twenty from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, as he aſſerted in the Houſe of Lords, when he was accuſed there of Popery; he was alſo to be removed: For, ſince the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and Civil Governments were to be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, it was thought proper, that the Principal Aſſerters of both, ſhould be ſacrificed to the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh Noveliſts.</hi> Neither did the Fates of theſe Great Men, ſuffice to diſpel the pretended Fears and Jealouſies of the <hi>Commons;</hi> for, being elated, not ſatisfied, with theſe unexpected Conceſſions, they only encreaſed their Appetites; and, ſeeing now they were feared, and that, by the Madneſs of the People, whom they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd with an Opinion of their Sanctity, there was a way laid open to greater Matters; they did not bluſh to attempt the King's Royal Perſon and Family: Who, though he had granted more to the Petitions of the Parliament, than ever any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects had demanded, he would yet have yielded to more, for the Good of his People, provided it did not intrench upon his Honour and Conſcience. But theſe Conceſſions did not ſuffice them, who would have all, though they did not yet declare ſo far. In the mean time, they looked upon what the King had ſo generouſly beſtowed upon them, but as Dues, interpreting them to have proceeded from his Neceſſities, not Inclinations; ſo that nothing he could either ſay, or do, could gain
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97792:19"/>the Favour of this Ungrateful Faction.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The King's Conceſsions.</note>After the Death of <hi>Strafford,</hi> his Majeſty had denied them nothing that they had not been aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ask. The <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> the <hi>Archbiſhop's Court,</hi> as alſo that of the <hi>Northern</hi> Borders, were taken away. Other Courts, as thoſe of the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> and of <hi>Ludlow, &amp;c.</hi> were circumſcribed in narrower Bounds. <hi>Monopolies</hi> were entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> and thoſe other Maritime Revenues, that never Prince had as yet parted with, were ſuppreſſed. To all this a <hi>Triennial Parliament</hi> (leſt any ſhould dare to offend for the future) and the Continuance of this, during the Pleaſure of the Two Houſes, as is already ſaid, was unhappily aſſented unto. And further, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Candour of his Intentions, he admitted ſeveral of the moſt popular of the Faction, of his Privy-Council; the <hi>Lord Say,</hi> being made Maſter of the <hi>Wards; Eſſex, Lord Chamberlain; Holland, Groom</hi> of the <hi>Stole; Leiceſter, Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and <hi>St. John, Sollicitor General.</hi> But what Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution did they make the King, for all theſe Graces and Indulgences of Favour?

                        <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> having been kept thus long by the Parliament, to awe the King, and now ſufficiently Burthenſom to the Kingdom, the Parliament ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſerved their Turn of them, were to be ſent Home;<note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> diſmiſſed.</note> and are now diſmiſſed, having exacted by Contibutions, Rapines, Spoils, Gratuities and Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, above a Million of Money from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their Repreſentatives.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97792:19"/>Invitation, not Invaſion. Nor would our grave Senators, have honoured them with the Title of <hi>Dear Brethren,</hi> or procured an Order to declare them faithful and loyal Subjects, (having been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Rebels by the King) and that in all the Churches and Chapels, upon a Thanksgiving day; nor have contributed ſo largely to their Subſiſtance, but that they had conſpired with them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogated their Councils, by the ſame manner of rebelling: For it would have coſt leſs in Money, and Honour, to have forced them, as Enemies, out of our Borders, than to retain them in <hi>England</hi> by a ſordid Compliance, as Friends? By allowing them Quarters, they impoſe a Burthen upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which they eaſe by a Taxation upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But their Deſign had always been, to keep the.

The <hi>Iriſh</hi> following the deteſtable Example of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had attained by Arms what their Ambition had deſigned, outwent them only in this, That they Rebelled more bloodily. 'Tis ſtrange with what induſtry, ſo univerſal and ſo nefarious a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy was concealed, which was ſcarce diſcovered, but with the inhumane Slaughter of an Hundred Thouſand Perſons. And it is ſcarce conceivable, that thoſe who were at the Helm of Government, ſhould be ſo negligent or ſupine, as to ſuffer a <hi>Plot</hi> of this horrid Nature, to gather to a Head, and break out, to the Infection of the whole Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, without any the leaſt Diſcovery, or pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating into it. Eſpecially ſeeing his Majeſty, whoſe Eye was ſtill awake for the Preſervation of his People,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.</note> had Cautioned the Lords Chief-Juſtices, <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Burlace,</hi> of ſome dangerous Deſigns in agitation in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that, Six Months before this fatal Eruption, which His Majeſty alſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to them he had been acquainted with, from his Ambaſſadors and Agents in Foreign Courts. Nor was the Information of Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> who certified them Twelve Days before it broke out, of unuſual Reſorts and Concourſes of ſuſpicious Perſons amongſt themſelves, ſo deſpicable, but that it ought to have been inquired into; and ſuch Means and Preparations ſhould in common Prudence have been uſed, as might have checkt any ſudden Attempts or Inſurrections whatſoever. And truly, the great Supineneſs, and Security of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in general, did not a little contribute to their Ruine. For they could apprehend no Danger, conſidering the perfect Intelligence betwixt them and the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> cemented by inter-Marriages, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97792:20"/>all other imaginable Ties of Friendſhip; which ſeemed the more ſecure, ſeeing the Catholicks were permitted the private Enjoyment of their Religion, and had obtained, not onely a conſiderable Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Subſidies, but many advantageous Redreſſes from the King's Favour, in all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; ſo that they were, at this preſent, in a more flouriſhing Condition, than they had yet enjoyed ſince their firſt Subjection. In this Security, the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> Army had been disbanded, but the Soldiery not diſpoſed of, according to the King's Intention, and Promiſes to foreign Embaſſadors, who for want of other Employment, proved very aſſiſting to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Rebellion, by engaging in it.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who had ſo often and for ſo many Ages endeavoured to vindicate their Liberty, and ſhake off the heavy Yoke of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> thinking now the Occaſion (by the Death of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Their Reae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> and the disbanding of the Army he had raiſed) very inviting, they eagerly laid hold on it, hoping to emancipate themſelves from the Slavery they groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under; or at leaſt, in Imitation of the <hi>Scots,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by Arms, as they had done, new Immunities and Privileges. But the main thing inſiſted upon, was their Religion, which had been derived to them by an immemorial Series of Anceſtors, and which they always adhered to, with inexpreſſible <hi>Bigottry:</hi> ſo that obſerving it to be extreamly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in <hi>England,</hi> and fearing the like Meaſure at Home, it ſerved for the main Pretence of their Rebellion. Nor is it abſurd to believe, but that the Conſpirators in <hi>England,</hi> contributed equally to theſe Tumults, as they had done before to the <hi>Scottiſh Commotions,</hi> ſince<note n="*" place="margin">Clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, Pryn, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> ſome of their Party affirmed, <hi>That the Converſion of the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>was to be effected with the Sword in one hand, and the Bible in the other.</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>could not do well without a Rebellion, to the end the Remnant of the Natives might be deſtroyed. They
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97792:21"/>would not leave a Prieſt in</hi> Ireland, <hi>but extirpate their Superſtition and Nation.</hi> So that it was thought by many, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were forced by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by theſe Provocations, to take up Arms, that they might, upon ſo plauſible a pretext, be intirely rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and rooted out, as Rebels and Traytors. What other Reaſons they gave, as Oppreſſion, Grievances, Privileges, &amp;c. common to all Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may paſs as ſuch; but that they ſhould pretend to vindicate the King's <hi>Prerogative</hi> by deſtroying it, is only proper to them, and thoſe nefarious Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides who did ſo naturally copy them. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were the Pretences of the Revolters, it is but rational to believe they had never broke out, but for the Proſpect they had of a Breach (which they could not but know from their Committee at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> moſt whereof were Catholicks, and many, as the Lord <hi>Germanſton, &amp;c.</hi> prime Actors in the Rebellion) betwixt the King and Parliament.

                        <p>The ſtanding Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> conſiſting of ſcarce 1000 Horſe and 2000 Foot, were diſperſed in the ſeveral Fortreſſes of the Kingdom; but ſo remote, that it was not poſſible, the ways being intercepted by the Rebels, to draw them to a Body: beſides, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them being Catholicks, revolted, and others were ſurpriſed or intercepted, ſo that few of them could be brought to <hi>Dublin.</hi> The City was in the mean time fortified, with all imaginable Induſtry; being alſo daily filled with Numbers of ſuch, who fled from the cruel and inhumane Barbarities of the Rebels. Of theſe, and the neighbouring <hi>Engliſh,</hi> two Regiments were formed, whereof Sir <hi>Henry Tichburne</hi> had one, together with the Government of <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> the other, with the Command of <hi>Dublin.</hi> Theſe two Places being the principal Fortreſſes of the Party.</p>
                        <p>The Juſtices and Council diſpatched an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to the King, who was then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> of the Diſcovery and Progreſs of the Conſpiracy. His Majeſty highly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, as moſt concerned, with this monſtrous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; offers all his Aſſiſtance for the ſuppreſſing of it; acquaints the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> with it, and demands their Aid in it; conjures the two Houſes at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and empowers them to uſe the utmoſt of Force and Counſel to prevent the Progreſs of the Rebellion, and deliver his Proteſtant Subjects, from the Calamities that threatned them. Nay, ſometime after he offered to go in Perſon, and raiſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97792:22"/>10000 <hi>Voluntiers</hi> for that Service, if the Parliament would but pay them; all which they refuſe, under pretence of not expoſing his Sacred Perſon to ſo eminent Danger; but in truth, preferring their own Fears to the Solace of ſo many deſolate Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: and leſt, when he had conquered thoſe Rebels, he might be ſenſible of the Injuries done him, and being armed become formidable to the Parliament it ſelf. The Houſes indeed voted a powerful Relief of Men, Money, and Proviſions, but they were but ſlow in Performance, retarding the Supplies they had ſo eagerly ordered, with their undutiful Diſputes, and Quarrels with the Court, till the whole was well nigh loſt. Bleeding <hi>Ireland</hi> was the Subject of their Diſcourſe, not their Care, being too much taken up with the Management of their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns at Home, ſo that they went no farther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides exclaiming at the Obſtacles, they themſelves created; and that by a Calumny black as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion it ſelf, they caſt the Odium of thoſe Delays, upon the unſulliedſt Innocence in the World, the King: than whom, no Prince could be more ſenſibly affected with the greatneſs of the Calamity, nor deſired the Wellfare of his Subjects with more Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

But the <hi>Faction</hi> impatient of every Repulſe, in revenge, framed a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> in his abſence; wherein, whatever was defective in the Government, was, as uſually, attributed to his Counſellours, with the uſual Reflections upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But, the Misfortunes, and what Errors were committed, ought truly to be laid at their Doors, which they were not ignorant of, ſeeing the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> abſolutely denied to ſupply the Neceſſities of the Crown, both at Home and Abroad, whereby things often miſcarried,<note place="margin">The Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance.</note> and Money was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times raiſed by extraordinary Ways.

This <hi>Proteſtation</hi> appeared very plauſible at firſt ſight, promiſing to defend Religion according to Law, and the King according to Religion; if it had not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred occaſion to thoſe fictitious Bug-bears of <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies;</hi> or planed, and uſhered the way, to that rebellious Confederation called the <hi>Covenant,</hi> betwixt theſe perfidious Wretches, and their no leſs perfidious Brethren, the <hi>Scots.</hi> The <hi>Faction</hi> alſo in proceſs of time, explaining this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,</hi> affirmed their meaning to be, That by the true <hi>Reformed Proteſtant Religion,</hi> expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Popiſh Innovations, contrary to the ſame Doctrine, is meant only the publick Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the Church, ſo far, as it is oppoſite to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and Popiſh Innovation: and that the ſaid words, are not to extend to the maintaining of any Form of Worſhip, Diſcipline or Government; nor of any Rites, or Ceremonies of the ſaid Church of <hi>England:</hi> ſo that upon the Matter, it ſeems manifeſt, that the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> were plainly deſigned for Extirpation.</p>
                        <p>The other Arts, whereby the <hi>Bell-weathers</hi> of the <hi>Faction</hi> daily incenſed the People, were the feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then themſelves detecting of Plots and Conſpiracies, and imaginary Deſigns, wherewith they ſtrangely troubled and afrighted the giddy Rabble; who, by an implicit Credulity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all that was told them, to the prejudice of the King or his Friends, whom they ſtigmatized with the odious Characters of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</hi> Nor was it an Artifice of leſs Cunning in them, to procure Subſcriptions from the unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97792:24"/>Crowd, to occaſional Petitions of their own framing; pretending Grievances and Dangers, and demanding Remedies againſt them, as in publick Calamities.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, the King hitherto patient, ſeeing his Clemency more and more abuſed, by the Contumacy of his Adverſaries, reſolved to puniſh theſe Diſturbers of the Publick Peace: And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed, that ſome Members of Parliament had private Meeting and Caballing with the <hi>Scots,</hi> who alſo had countenanced the late Tumults; he gave Warrants to ſeize their Papers, and ſecure their Perſons; but they being withdrawn, he cauſed One of the <hi>

                        <p>After ſome Stay there, <hi>his Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> went to <hi>Dover,</hi> with the <hi>Princeſs Mary,</hi> married ſome Time ſince to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> from whence the Queen paſſed into <hi>Holland,</hi>

                        <p>This Conduct, as it happened, proved Fatal to the King.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97792:26"/>Nor was the King ſo abandoned by his People, but that many honeſt and brave Men, as well of their own Accord, as very many more by <hi>Gurney,</hi> the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi>'s Procurement, mingled themſelves with the Rabble, with deſign to defend the King's Sacred Perſon, from the Inſults and Violence of the Crowd, if they ſhould preſume to attempt any thing againſt him. Nay, the whole Society of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> (which ſhewed, That the <hi>Law</hi> as well as <hi>Reaſon</hi> was for him) coming to <hi>Whitehall</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, offered themſelves to guard his Majeſty; which ſeaſonable profeſſion of Duty, drew from the King, both his Acknowledgements and Thanks; though he otherwiſe waved the offer ſuppoſing thoſe popular Heats and Inſurrections, might be beſt allayed by removing, and yielding; and leſt alſo, he might be thought to meditate a War.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Parliament</hi> to add Credit, at leaſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to the Terrors they had imbued the People with, gave Power to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Juſtices of Peace</hi> in the Counties, to ſuppreſs all ſeditious and ſuſpected Aſſemblies, and ſeize upon all Arms and Inſtruments of War, and ſecure the ſame.

But theſe, being inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Flowers of the <hi>Crown,</hi> were not to be parted with to any; and his Majeſty being again preſſed to it, continued immoveable, telling them in ſhort, <hi>That their Fears, and Doubts, and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97792:26"/>which he looked upon as wild and irregular, were ſuch, as he would take time to ſatisfie the World of; but that his own were not trivial, occaſioned by the many ſcandalous Pamphlets, ſeditious Sermons, ſundry publick Tumults hitherto uninquired into, and unpuniſhed.</hi> But the <hi>Faction</hi> ſeeing the Conſtancy of the King, formed a Declaration, wherein, after a nauſeous Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Grievances, Fears and Jealouſies, they again peremptorily demand the diſpoſal of the <hi>Militia;</hi> and being again refuſed, reſolved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort it from their King, with all their Force. Nor was it abſurd in them; for, being conſcious of their Crimes and Deſerts, they could not imagine how to ſecure themſelves from the Puniſhment due to their Guilt, but by aſſerting the Power of the Sword in their own Hands. They therefore paſſed their Ordinance for the <hi>Militia,</hi> though with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proteſting, That they had not the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or Purpoſe of any War with the King (but how falſly!) which made it ſwallowed the eaſier.

This Summons was anſwered by Two great Guns, and being advanced nearer, the King obſerved the Rebels Army to be drawn up as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: Two Regiments of Horſe compoſed the Right Wing, commanded by the Two Colonels, <hi>Balfore</hi> and <hi>Stapelton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fielding</hi> had his Regiment in their Rear for a Reſerve. <hi>Eſſex</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Battel, at firſt alſo on Foot as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe General; and the Left Wing, conſiſting of Twenty Troops of Horſe, was led by Colonel <hi>Ramſey,</hi> a <hi>Scot.</hi> And now the Cannon began to play on both Sides, but without any conſiderable Execution. <hi>Prince Rupert</hi> charged <hi>Ramſey</hi> with ſo much Courage, that he not only forced him from his Station, but off the Field alſo; and the Brigade of Foot next to them, frighted with the Flight of their Horſe, and ſurprized with the Defection of Sir <hi>Faithful Forteſcue</hi> (who mindful of his Duty, went over with his Troops to his Majeſty) threw down their Arms, <hi>Colonel Eſſex,</hi> who commanded them, retiring to the <hi>Main Body.</hi> But our Horſe following the Chace too far, and their Reſerves commanded by the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Carnarven,</hi> and hurried with the ſame Violence, ſuffered the Victory to ſlip out of their Hands, by their too much eagerneſs to overcome. For, if they had charged their Flank, bared of their Horſe, they had probably much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded them. <hi>Eſſex</hi> was more cautious, who ſending <hi>Fielding</hi>'s Reſerve, with others under the Command of <hi>Hurrey,</hi> did much diſturb the King's Foot, deſtitute by the Abſence of their Horſe. The Left Wing had not the ſame Succeſs, for <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> had forced <hi>Willmot</hi> to a diſorderly Retreat, and breaking Two Battalions of Foot, left naked by the Flight of their Horſe on that Side, opened
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97792:31"/>a paſſage to the King's Standard.

The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Lindſey</hi> was ſlain there, having performed all the Parts of a great Captain; and, his Eldeſt Son haſtning to his Aſſiſtance, was taken Priſoner. The Battel being reſtored by the Acceſſion of freſh Supplies on the King's Side, and the Evening approaching, they left combating as if by conſent, both Sides being weary, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels alſo in want of Ammunition. Both Sides therefore rallying their ſhatter'd Forces, drew up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Battalia,</hi> as at the Beginning. By this the Prince was returned, who, if he had not amuſed himſelf in that vain purſuit, and Plundering of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Carriages at <hi>Keynton,</hi> the War had been ended at this firſt Blow.</p>

The Enemies Foot, notwithſtanding the Flight of their Horſe, ſtood firm; nor would be broken, until they perceived our Foot marching out of Town, who advanced but ſlowly for fear of Ambuſhes; and then they threw down their Arms, and diſperſed, but to little purpoſe, being well nigh all kill'd or taken. There were Eight hundred ſlain, Two thouſand taken, Four Braſs Pieces of Ordnance, with all their Ammunition,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97792:37"/>and great Store of Proviſions; beſides Eight and Twenty Foot Colours, and Nine Cornets of Horſe.

But the King, contrary to his own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Advice, being overborn by his <hi>Council of War,</hi> or rather betrayed by his <hi>Fate,</hi> and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy of ſome pretended Friends, omitting <hi>London</hi> the Head of the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> miſerably ſquandered that Time which was irrecoverable, in the <hi>unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Siege of</hi> Gloceſter, whilſt <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> amuſed himſelf about <hi>Hull.</hi> Whereas, if they had joined their Forces, the Rebels having no Army then in the Field to oppoſe them, he might not only have routed the <hi>pretended Parliament,</hi> who were already upon the Point to diſſodge, but have given Law to that proud City, the Source of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> and his <hi>Misfortunes.</hi> But, it ſeemed otherwiſe good to <hi>Providence;</hi> and, the <hi>Two Houſes,</hi> who were in a deſponding Condition, raiſed with this unhoped for Opportunity, recruited their empty Regiments well nigh ruined with Sickneſs and Sedition, with

                           <hi>Eſſex</hi> muſtered his Army, the <hi>Members of both Houſes</hi> being preſent, upon <hi>Hounſley-Heath,</hi> which did not exceed Ten Thouſand Men; too weak for the Expedition they were deſigned: but being much reinforced by the City-Auxiliaries, and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned-Bands, marched that Night to <hi>Colebroke,</hi> and ſo forward. <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> ſeated upon the Banks of <hi>Severne,</hi> was, with the Addition of ſome Works, and the River, eſteemed ſtrong. <hi>Colonel Maſſey,</hi> an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and vigilant Commander, was Governour, ſtrengthened with Two Regiments of Foot and Two Troops of Horſe: who, however vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly attacked, did no leſs vigorouſly oppoſe Force to Force, Sallies to Aſſaults, and Countermines to the Mines from without. But, in truth, neither underſtood the Methods of beſieging, or defending as yet; that Part of War being but in its Infancy amongſt us. But, we muſt allow the Defenſive to have carried it here, ſeeing they held it out, until the Arrival of their Succours. The King being advertized of the Enemies Advance, ſent <hi>Prince Rupert</hi> with all the Horſe to retard their March; which he did, by continual Excurſions, Velitations and forcing of Poſts and Quarters. At <hi>Stow in the Wowld,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> drawing all his Horſe in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Line, upon the Side of the Hill, made a very great Appearance.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97792:39"/>more were preſently ſent to his Aſſiſtance; the which, with the Thunder of their Cannon, obliged the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> after ſome skirmiſhing to retire to their Body, which being compoſed only of Horſe, did alſo give way to this great Army which advanced upon them.</p>
                        <p>The King preferring the Bleſſings of Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Triumphs of Victory, ſent a Trumpeter with Propoſitions to <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who anſwered crudely enough, <hi>That he had Orders to relieve</hi> Gloceſter, <hi>not to treat;</hi> which he alſo did, the King riſing from the Siege at his Approach, and paſſing the River, with a Reſolution to fight the Rebels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their return. And this ſeemed another Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> raiſed.</note> for, if the King had fought them before they reached the Town, he had probably either beaten them, or impeded their Progreſs; both, or either of which, would infallibly have obliged them to ſurrender. <hi>Eſſex</hi> having relieved the Town, his next Care was to preſerve his Army, eſpecially the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners,</hi> the Chief Strength of it; which he in a great Manner did, by his Surprizal of <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> where he found Store of Proviſions, which he much wanted. The <hi>Royalliſts</hi> obſtructing the Enemy in their Return, upon every Occaſion, fell into their Rear upon <hi>Auburne Chaſe</hi> with all their Horſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it up to their Main Body.

                        <p>The next Morning, the King's Army being drawn up near <hi>Newbury,</hi> having the River on their Right-Hand, expected the Rebels there.<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
                           </note> There was a little Hill Five Hundred Paces from the Town, which the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> had poſſeſſed and fortified with Guns. <hi>Eſſex</hi> perceiving it, and having no other

But, the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> were forced to make as much haſt back, having been ſaluted with a Volley of Shot from the adverſe Foot, poſted there, and not without loſs. The King's <hi>Right</hi> and the Enemies <hi>Left-Wing,</hi> being hindred by Hedges and Incloſures, fought only by ſmall Parties and light Skirmiſhes. Nor had the Foot, though they fought ſtoutly, any ſignal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of each other; the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Brentford,</hi> on the King's ſide, and <hi>Major General Skippon</hi> on the <hi>Rebels,</hi> behaving themſelves with equal Courage and Vigilancy. The <hi>Royalliſts</hi> had taken ſome Field-pieces, which they were forced to quit again with loſs. The approaching Evening put an end to this bloody Conteſt, and the King's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Army rallied and drew up again, as at firſt, in the Field where they had fought, with deſign to renew the Combat in the Morning; which yet they did not, being content to ſend <hi>Major General Harvey,</hi> who had lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted them, with a ſtrong Party of Horſe and Foot to fall in their Rear. They had alſo ſtood in Arms all Night, not retreating before the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which time they were cloſe followed, and charged; their Rear-guard, commanded by <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton,</hi> being forced up to their Foot with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loſs. There were ſlain on the King's Side
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97792:40"/>many eminent Perſons, as the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Carnarven</hi> and <hi>Sunderland,</hi> the Wiſe <hi>Lord Faukland</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Morgan,</hi> with others.

But, the King ſollicitous for <hi>Oxford,</hi> as alſo for <hi>Pomfret Caſtle,</hi> which had been long beſieged, deſigned to relieve both; and, being neareſt the City, ſent a ſtrong Party of Horſe, with a great Number of Sheep and Cattel, to its Relief, and encamped with the reſt of his Army upon <hi>Borrow-hill.</hi> The Convoy having ſuccour'd <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Expedition of <hi>Pomfret,</hi> by <hi>Langdale</hi>'s Perſwaſion, was reſolved upon.

The Circuit of the Place was not large, being defended by Eighteen Hundred Soldiers, Forty Guns mounted upon the Walls, with great Stores of other Military Proviſions. But, the <hi>Rebels</hi> fierce with their former Victories, and ſlighting all this, caſt Lots for the Poſts they were to attempt. But, firſt they ſummon the Citizens to a Surrender, with Threats of all the Extremities of War in caſe of Refuſal. Colonel <hi>Edmond Windham,</hi> the <hi>Governour,</hi> no leſs brave than Loyal, returning the Meſſenger with Scorn, prepared for Defence. Which ſo irritated the Enemy, that planting their Cannon, they alſo ran floating Bridges into the Graft, which was not difficult, by reaſon of its nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs; and, ſtorming the Walls, with great Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, notwithſtanding their utmoſt Reſiſtance, mounted them, and beating the beſieged from their Bullwarks ſeize their Cannon, and turn them upon

And thus this part of the Town (it being, as is ſaid, divided by a Chanel) was taken, as alſo Five Hundred of the Defendants in it. Nor did this terriſie the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who refuſing another Invitation to ſurrender, conſumed with Fire from Granadoes, and glowing Bullets, that Portion of the.

Upon publiſhing hereof, the Governour's Lady, and ſome other of that Sex, accepting this unexpected Gallantry, went out: Who were no ſooner departed, but the Enemy thundred upon the Town with their Mortar-pieces, Cannon, Fireballs and inceſſant Showers of ſmall Shot, that the Buildings were all in a Flame.

And, though he had been purſued by Ten Thouſand Horſe, the (<hi>Scottiſh</hi> Cavalry being joined with the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) and that with the utmoſt Obſtinacy, yet they could not prevent him.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> however fattened with their Reſt and Quarters, would not yet leave them, without the Allurements of Prayers, and Money. Being then paid, they were perſwaded to move <hi>Southwards;</hi> and,<note place="margin">

                        <p>The King did not ſtay long in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my growing upon him after their Victory, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into <hi>Wales,</hi> ſtill loyal to his Intereſt; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prince however unfortunate, inſuperable in Afflictions, and Superior to all Calamities.

He had already acted to a Prodigy, as will be hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; but, they could not reach the Borders, and Confines of both Kingdoms. For though they had broke Colonel <hi>Wren</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Eight Hundred Foot at <hi>Sherburne,</hi> and <hi>Mylford,</hi> they were afterwards ſurpriſed by <hi>Copely</hi> and <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> who being freſh, fell upon their wearied

The Lord <hi>Digby</hi>'s Coach was alſo made a Prize, wherein amongſt other Spoils, ſeveral of the King's Letters, too careleſly guarded, were found. And theſe, as thoſe formerly taken at <hi>Naeſby,</hi> were printed with the ſame Malice and Impudence. Nor is it to be wondred, that as they began the War with Tumults, Scandals, and all Kinds of Barbarity; ſo they ſhould end it, with the ſame Arts, and the ſame Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Digby</hi> was again routed by the <hi>Scots</hi> upon <hi>Carlile</hi>-Sands, and ſcarce ſaved himſelf by with-drawing with very few Attendants into the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Ireland.</hi> So that this whole Party, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with its Deſign, was deſtroyed and vaniſhed.</p>
                        <p>But to return to <hi>Fairfax</hi> into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> where the main Streſs of the War was (for, what happened in other Provinces, were rather Velitations, and Encounters of Parties, than formed Deſigns of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels) after the taking of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Enemy conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what to undertake next. Many were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhould march to the Relief of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> labouring under the Evils of a very long, and irkſom Siege. But that Town having the Sea open, and the <hi>Parliamentarians</hi> abounding in ſhipping, having the Navy at their Diſpoſal, it was thought more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to diſlodge the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> out of thoſe Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which impeded the Commerce betwixt <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Counties; and, ſo open a Paſſage for Travellers, to and fro, at Pleaſure. In order to this, <hi>Barclay-Caſtle,</hi> as neareſt, was firſt attempted. This Fortreſs lying betwixt <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> did not only diſturb the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of both thoſe Cities, but extreamly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded the Country on every ſide, with Excurſions. <hi>Fairfax</hi> had formerly ſent ſome Horſe to hinder

For, Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> however brave, being unequal to the Enemy in Power, was forced to ſurrender; which he did, conſidering the State of Affairs, upon no contemptible Conditions. In the mean Time, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> took the <hi>Devizes;</hi>

                           </note> which they took by Aſſault, without the Loſs of ſcarce one ſingle Man, though the Town was ſtrengthened with a Hundred pieces of Ordnance.

                        <p>The <hi>Rebels</hi> marched thence to <hi>Totnes,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards returned to the Siege of <hi>Exeter.</hi> Sir <hi>Hardres Waller</hi> had commanded there; and, now it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, to attempt the forcing of the Place, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hitherto been but block'd up with Forts and Redoubts.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97792:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>For, the <hi>Lord Goring</hi> being gone for <hi>France,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entruſted his own Troops to the <hi>Lord Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s Conduct; the Government of the whole was devolved upon this excellent Perſonage: Who now had, with Three Thouſand Horſe and Four Thouſand Foot, poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Torrington,</hi> with a Reſolution to defend the Town, and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard there the Extremity of War. <hi>Fairfax</hi> being advertiſed of all this by his Spies, quickens his March: and, to give the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> no time to fortifie themſelves, made all imaginable haſte. <hi>Hopton</hi> had lined the neighbouring Avenues with Muſqueteers, which he again quitted upon the Enemies Advance, who alſo poſſeſſed the ſaid Places: Where they fix'd their Station, by reaſon of the Darkneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a Noiſe in the Town, creating an Opinion that the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> were diſlodging, obliged them to ſend a Party to ſee what was the matter. Theſe Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers being received with a Volley of Shot, were ſeconded by a Reſerve, and they again by a Third and Fourth Party; ſo that Supplies being ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſent from both ſides, both Armies were at length engaged. The Paſſage into the Town was barricado'd up,<note place="margin">The Fight at <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington.</hi>
                           </note> where the Fight was very ſharp, at puſh of Pike, and Butt-Ends of Muſquets; but that being gained, the Encounters in the Street were no leſs brave.

The Horſe, by Benefit of the Night, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Ways, did well-nigh all ſave themſelves by Flight. Four Hundred as well Commons as Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were taken; of which, near Two Hundred were blown up with the <hi>Church. Hopton</hi> had left
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97792:67"/>Fourſcore Barrels of Powder in it, which being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Accident, or by one <hi>Watts,</hi> as it was ſaid, hired thereto for Thirty Pieces of Gold, I will not determine. But however it happened, very many of the Rebels periſhed with it; the Town was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably ſhaken, and Terror and Deſtruction were ſcattered every where by the Dreadfulneſs of the Noiſe, and the Vibration of the Ruines of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Enemy following the Chace, forced the Cavaliers over the River <hi>Tamar;</hi> and, advancing forwards, beat Colonel <hi>Baſſet</hi> out of <hi>Launceſton,</hi> which they alſo poſſeſſed.</p>

                           </note>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> admoniſhed by the frequent Misfortunes of his Party, and ſeeing, after this laſt Defeat, no poſſibility of renewing the War, took ſhipping at <hi>Truro.</hi> And, that he might with-draw himſelf, from theſe barbarous and bloody Enemies to his Life, and Fame; and being attended on by the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Hyde,</hi> ſince <hi>Lord Chancellor of England,</hi> ſailed to the <hi>Iſles of Scylly,</hi> and thence into <hi>France;</hi> reſerving himſelf, by the Care of Providence, for the ſignal Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his enſlaved Kingdoms, to their former Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Fairfax</hi> did not omit to improve this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Prince's Retreat, by inviting <hi>Hopton,</hi> by honourable Conditions, to disband his Forces, as being abandoned and left to himſelf. The Greatneſs of the thing, kept him in ſuſpenſe for ſome Time. It grieved him to the Soul, to ſee his King, and deareſt Lord, deprived of ſo many brave Men, and ſuch a gallant Body of Horſe, and that by his own Act. But, to conſerve them, ſeemed morally impoſſible; for, there was no Help to be expected from Abroad, and he himſelf ſhut up within the compaſs of Six Miles, in the Streights of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> ſurrounded by the Sea, and a victorious, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile Army. Nor, did he know whither to go, in caſe he had broke through; the Ways being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97792:68"/>with Trees, cut down and laid croſs them on purpoſe; the Paſſages every where kept with ſtrong Guards; and what was more diſmal, the King's Affairs were under ſuch ſad Circumſtances, and ſo deſperate, that we were deprived of the very Solace of Hope. In this Extremity, it was determined, to lay by our now uſeleſs Arms, and ſubmit to the Neceſſity of our Fate. A Treaty was therefore entered upon, by Commiſſioners from both ſides,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> disbands bis Army.</note> who met at <hi>Treſſilian-Bridge;</hi> and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great Conteſtation, concluded a Diſſolution of the <hi>Royal-Army.</hi> The Officers, each according to his Quality, were permitted the Enjoyment of their Arms, Horſes and Equipage. But, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Troopers, were obliged to deliver theirs, receiving every one Twenty Shillings in Lieu of them. All had their Bag, Baggage, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties ſecured to them, and Permiſſion to return to their Homes, or to paſs into Foreign Countries at pleaſure. The Army being disbanded, and the Garriſons thereby excluded from all Hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, did likewiſe fall. <hi>Exeter</hi> the Chief City of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſurrender'd upon honourable Terms. <hi>Barnſtable</hi> followed, as alſo the remaining Garriſons, upon Demand.

Which I hitherto deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly omitted, not willing to interupt the Progreſs of this <hi>Weſtern</hi> Expedition.

                           <note place="margin">Feb. 3. 1645/6.</note> was followed by the Surrender of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> a Place of no leſs Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

                              <hi>Cheſter,</hi> makes a brave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> attempted the Town by Aſſault, having made a conſiderable Breach. But, they were beat off with much Loſs, <hi>Venables</hi> being ſlain in the Action. This Succeſs added ſo much Courage, and Confidence to the beſieged, that they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of being able to defend themſelves, and diſturb the Enemy. In the mean time, the King ſollicitous for the Relief of this important Place, had attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, but unſucceſsfully; for, being defeated, as is already mentioned, at <hi>Rowton-Heath,</hi> his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty not willing to be ſhut up in a beſieged Place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated into <hi>Wales.</hi> The <hi>Lord Byron,</hi> a Perſon of great Honour, and Loyalty, was Governour of this conſiderable Garriſon, who no whit diſmayed after
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97792:71"/>the late Misfortune, however preſſed by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, omitted no Duty of a brave Commander. <hi>Poynts,</hi> after the King's Departure, fierce with his Victory, did not doubt to carry the City by Force, not being able to gain it by Threats. For, beating the Walls with their Cannon from Three ſeveral Batteries at once, they made Three conſiderable Breaches; which however repaired by the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bravery of our Women, were valiantly aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, eſpecially that next the River, though repelled with great Loſs. Sir <hi>William Byron,</hi> the Governour's Brother, had got Four Hundred Horſe with Proviſions, which he attempted to relieve the Place with; but, he was beaten, and himſelf made a Priſoner near <hi>Holt.</hi> Neither was Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> more fortunate, although followed by Two Thouſand Horſe; for, he was forced by <hi>Colonel Mitton,</hi> with additional Troops from the Siege, near <hi>Denbigh,</hi> after ſeveral ſharp Encounters, to a Retreat. The Enemy returning victorious, lay a more cloſe Siege to the City; for, they now alſo encamped on the <hi>Welſh Side,</hi> which had hitherto been kept open. So, that the Place being ſhut up all round, the beſieged in time ſpent all their freſh Proviſions; and, not long after, their Patience. Whereupon they, eſpecially the Citizens, began to be very uneaſie, although their Mutterings, did not ſurpaſs the Modeſty of Words; for, as they had ſeveral times bravely ſuſtained the Inſults of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, ſo they did not ſuffer themſelves to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ordinary Neceſſities. The Garriſon conſiſted moſt of <hi>Welſh,</hi> the Officers being of the ſame Nation, reſolved to ſuffer all Extremities for their King, rather than the imperious Government of the <hi>Rebels.</hi> Nor were the Citizens leſs ſignal in their Valour and Conſtancy, until their whole ſtock of Proviſions was ſpent. Horſe-fleſh and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Viands leſs conſiſtent with Nature, were now
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97792:72"/>accompted Delicacies; but, thoſe likewiſe failing, they were neceſſitated to deſire a Remedy for ſo many Evils, in a Surrender; which ſeemed yet worſe than the Diſeaſe it ſelf, at leaſt to the brave. They therefore beſiege the Governour, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreat him, ſince there was no viſible Hopes of Relief, that he would be pleaſed to treat with the Enemy for their Preſervation. <hi>Brereton</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame, at the ſame Time by a Trumpeter: demonſtrating, <hi>the King's Forces to have been beaten out of the Field every where, and their Remains ſhut up in Garriſons; ſo that, there was no kind of Relief to be expected. He would notwithſtanding, and did, offer very reaſonable Conditions, provided they did not refuſe them, whilſt they might have them;</hi> which he the more eaſily conſented to, becauſe he much deſired to preſerve that Place, he was himſelf, upon its Rendition, to Command. And, <hi>Byron</hi> did not ſeem altogether averſe to the Supplications of the Citizens, or the Invitation of this Civil Enemy; yet, he delayed the matter, upon a Report, that <hi>Colonel Vaughan</hi> having joined the <hi>Lord Aſhley</hi> and ſome Recruits of <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> deſigned again the Succour of the Place. But, being uncertain of theſe Preparations, and ſhut up from all Commerce from Abroad; he ſent the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Relation,</hi> to ſee what was to be expected from that Conjunction of the <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts;</hi> reſolving to attend his Return. He, having broke through the Enemies Quarters, with Five and Twenty Horſe, found all theſe Reports to be falſe; which, having ſignified by Fires from the higheſt Tower of <hi>Flint-Caſtle,</hi> as was agreed upon, deſigned himſelf to return by Water into the City again; which he might poſſibly have done, by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the quick Tides, if he had not been hindred by great Sholes of Ice, which filled the River; ſo that with much ado he recovered <hi>Flint</hi> again. He alſo notified this Misfortune by Fires to the beſieged;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97792:72"/>which being perceived, conſidering every Delay now ſuperfluous,<note place="margin">is ſurrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon honourable Conditions.</note> the City was delivered up upon honourable Terms. The Garriſon was led by the Governour into <hi>Wales,</hi> where it was diſmiſſed; but, he ſhut himſelf in <hi>Caernarven,</hi> where being again beſieged, he was again forced to ſurrender upon Conditions, and to retire from that War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had behaved himſelf with no leſs Valour, than Misfortune.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fairfax</hi> being before this time advanced with his Army within ſight of <hi>Oxford,</hi> lay down before it; and, having obſerved the Situation of it, made a large Quarter capable of receiving Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men upon <hi>Hadington</hi>-Hill. Which he alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified very well; and, drawing a Line from thence round, he ſtrengthened it with other Forts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Colonels, <hi>Raynſborough, Lambert,</hi> and <hi>Herbert</hi> to command them. Whereby the City was entirely ſhut up.<note place="margin">Oxford <hi>beſieged by</hi> Fairfax.</note> The Enemy had ſeriouſly conſidered in a Council of War, how they might beſt render themſelves Maſters of this important Place, and at length agreed unanimouſly, that it being well fortified, it was ſafer to famiſh, than force it. They judged, that the only way to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, was to leave it to its own Neceſſities, and Diſſentions. They knew, the City was fortified after the modern Faſhion, the Baſtion and Flanks mutually defending each other. They ſaw, that the Rivers <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Charwell,</hi> did with their Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations cover Three Parts of the Town; and that the Fourth, which pointed to the <hi>North,</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable but on that ſide, though otherwiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Two Lines, and ſtrongly defended by the Colleges; appearing like ſo many Caſtles. To all this, the Garriſon conſiſted of Five Thouſand Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane Souldiers, and the Flower of the King's <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry;</hi> provided with all Kind of Stores for many Months, and commanded by Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham;</hi>
                           <pb n="130" facs="tcp:97792:73"/>Famous for his defending of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Carlile;</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which he had kept above Ten Months againſt the main Forces of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſuffering well-nigh a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntine Famine</hi> in its Defence. Nor did then quit it, but upon equitable Terms, for the Security of his Garriſon. At <hi>York</hi> alſo, he had extorted good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions from their victorious Armies. Theſe things being conſidered, <hi>Fairfax</hi> invites him alſo to treat, with very large Offers, which he ſeemed to hearken to; requiring Firſt, permiſſion to acquaint his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and to know his Pleaſure therein. This being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, Commiſſioners were ſome time after appointed to treat on both ſides. But, they could not agree; for, the Terms the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> demanded, were ſo high, that <hi>Fairfax</hi> transferred them to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> by which they were rejected as incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and new Orders ſent to the <hi>General,</hi> to reduce the <hi>City</hi> with all his Power and Skill. But, the Treaty was after ſome time reaſſumed, though no Ceſſation intervened, neither did any Military Action happen, worthy the recital; and, after ſome Diſputes, agreed upon, being comprehended in Six and Twenty Articles. <hi>Faringdon</hi> was likewiſe ſurrender'd upon the ſame Terms; for, Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> the Governour of that Fortreſs, being then in <hi>Oxford,</hi>

He had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been of the <hi>Covenanters</hi> Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was the firſt that led his Men over <hi>Tweed,</hi> in the firſt <hi>Scotch</hi> Invaſion. But, when he perceived that his Countrymen deſign'd not only the King's Ruine, but that of <hi>Monarchy</hi> too, he reſolved to quit them. He alſo wrote to the King, to teſtifie his Obedience.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97792:77"/>But, his Letters were ſtole out of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Poc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kets, by ſome of his <hi>Bed-chamber,</hi> and Copies of them conveyed to the <hi>Confederates;</hi> as alſo, notice of the King's Letters to <hi>Montroſs,</hi> which were intercepted, ſtitched up in a Saddle, as had been notified.

                        <p>The King indeed, had ordered the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to furniſh him with ſome Forces for the Expedition. And, <hi>Prince Rupert,</hi> after the fatal Battel of <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> had promiſed him a Body of Horſe; but all came to nothing, inſomuch, that he entred <hi>Scotland</hi> with only two Companions, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſguis'd in the habit and garb of a <hi>Groom,</hi> and by ſwift Journeys, came to the Banks of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Tai;</hi> where he lay cloſe for ſome days, in the houſe of <hi>Patrick Grimes,</hi> his Kinſman, a Perſon of great worth and Loyalty.

Which he alſo found to be true, as well by <hi>Alexander Macdonnel</hi>'s Letters who commanded them, as by others from ſeveral of his Friends in the Mountains. Having received theſe by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he anſwered them, as if he had been at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi> encouraging them highly with aſſurances, that they ſhould neither want Aſſiſtance, nor a <hi>General.</hi> Ordering them at the ſame time to deſcend with all ſpeed into <hi>Athol.</hi> Which they did, with Joy, upon the immediate Receipt of theſe Commands, ſooner than could imaginably be expected. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs,</hi> who was ſcarce twenty Miles off with his Couſin <hi>Patrick,</hi> habited like a <hi>Mountaineer,</hi> and on foot, ſurprizingly met them, which alſo happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very opportunely, they being in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being deſtroyed.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97792:78"/>with great Alacrity to <hi>Montroſs.</hi> Being thus accompanied, he the ſame day marched through the Fields of <hi>Athol</hi> towards <hi>Ierna,</hi> with deſign to open a paſſage for his Friends and Supplies, (if any ſuch ſhould be ſtirr'd up with the fame of his undertaking,) before it ſhould be ſhut up by the Enemy, ſurprized perhaps with the novelty of the thing, before they could rejoin their divided For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Having paſſed the <hi>Tai,</hi> the greateſt River in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was ſtrengthened by the acceſſion of five hundred Men,<note place="margin">as alſo the Lord <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi> and Sir <hi>Jo.

Heightened with theſe ſupplies, he beat the Enemy conſiſting of ſix thouſand Foot, and ſeven hundred horſe, commanded by the Lord of <hi>Elchon,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tullibardin,</hi> at <hi>Tippermoor. Montroſs</hi> had no Horſe at all. He therefore to prevent (by reaſon of the inequality of their numbers) being ſurrounded, extended his Front as much as poſſible, ſo that his Files being but three deep, the firſt Rank was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to kneel,<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Tipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor.</hi>
                           </note> the ſecond to ſtoop, and the third, where the propereſt Men were, to ſhoot ſtanding, and all to fire at once, and then to fall in with the Butt-ends of their Muskets, and their drawn Swords. All which was valiantly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but they wanting Powder, and not being well Armed, they fought with ſuch Weapons as chance furniſhed them with; throwing Stones with ſuch activity and animoſity at the Enemy, that they forced them firſt to give Ground, then to run away. The ſlain were reckoned at two Thouſand, and more taken. <hi>Perth</hi> was ſurrender'd to <hi>Montroſs</hi> the ſame day; where having reſted three more, he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97792:78"/>was informed, that <hi>Argile</hi> was marching towards him with a ſtrong Army. He therefore re-paſſing the <hi>Tai,</hi> encamped at <hi>Cupr</hi> in <hi>Angus,</hi> lying then, as well-nigh always, in the open Field. Paſſing thence by <hi>Taodan,</hi> he marched to <hi>Esk,</hi> where he met with the old <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Arley,</hi> with <hi>his Sons,</hi> and a brave train of Friends and Attendants. Here he had intelligence, that the Lord <hi>Burgley</hi> was at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene,</hi>

Which <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs</hi> underſtanding, having paſſed the River <hi>Dee,</hi> he found the Enemy drawn up in Battel Array near the City. <hi>Burgley</hi> had two thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, which he placed in the Wings; and having choſen his Ground, and planted his Cannon at the head of his Army, expected the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. <hi>Montroſs</hi> had but fifteen hundred Foot; for, the Lord of <hi>Kilpont</hi>'s Men were gone home, to convoy the Body of their <hi>Lord,</hi> who had been murther'd by one of his own Servants; and, very many of the <hi>Atholians</hi> were alſo returned loaden with Plunder after the Victory of <hi>Perth,</hi> and not yet come up to the Army. He alſo placed his Horſe, which were but four and forty, in the Wings: Adding ſome of his Foot to them, who for their Agility and Strength, were equal to Horſes; enjoyning them to have a care, leſt the Enemies Troops ſurrounded them. Which they alſo valiantly performed; for the Charge being given, the Enemy was defeated, ſlaughtered, routed. The Horſe eſcaped for the moſt part; but, the Foot having no place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to, but the City, fled thither. But being cloſely purſued by the Conquerours, entring Pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell with them, the Streets were ſtrowed with their ſlain Bodies. Two days being allowed the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to refreſh in, <hi>Montroſs</hi> was informed, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile</hi> was advancing with far greater Forces than formerly; being alſo accompanied, with the Earl
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97792:79"/>of <hi>Lothan</hi> with Fifteen Hundred Horſe. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and marched to <hi>Kintor,</hi> from whence he determined to lead his Forces to the Mountains and Places of moſt difficult acceſs. In order to this, he buried his Cannon in the Earth, and disburthened himſelf of his heavieſt Baggage. But, the Enemy preſſing on all ſides, he marched to <hi>Badenoth,</hi> that he might be out of the danger of their <hi>Cavalry,</hi> thoſe Quarters being ſcarce paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Horſe. The Enemy having left purſuing him, he was ſurprized by a fit of Sickneſs, which extreamly haraſſed him for ſome days; but, being recovered, he marched again into <hi>Angus,</hi> hoping either to force <hi>Argile,</hi> tired with tedious Marches, into <hi>Winter</hi> Quarters, or to leave him far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. Having traverſed <hi>Angus,</hi> and paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Grampian Mountain,</hi> he came to <hi>Strath-bogy,</hi> to invite the <hi>Gordons</hi> with his Preſence to a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Arms with him.

And truly, it may be a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe excellent Perſons moſt hated this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy. <hi>Montroſs</hi> highly troubled with this defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thought how to ſecure the reſt, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent the weakeſt of them away with all his Baggage, with Command to meet him at <hi>Brechin.</hi> This done, he with an Hundred and Fifty Horſe, which was all he had, and Six Hundred nimble Footmen, marched with incredible Speed to <hi>Tao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> which he aſſaulted, took, and plundered.

His Retreat was admirable, wherein he ſhewed himſelf no leſs a worthy Commander, than he had done in his former Victories. Some adviſed the General to reſerve himſelf for better times, and ſecure himſelf by flight with his Horſe; and, others under theſe deſperate Circumſtances, were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they ſhould not periſh unrevenged.

The Enemy diſcovering their number, and ſeeing them ſo few, divided their Forces, and followed after them very eagerly, not only coming up with them in their Rear and Flank, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to obſtruct their paſſage to the Mountains. The <hi>Rebels</hi> forlorn of Horſe, preſſed hard upon <hi>Montroſs</hi>'s Rear, but his Foot facing about, fired upon them, and having ſlain the three foremoſt, rendred the reſt more cautious, and the purſuit

By this they were come near <hi>Aberbroth,</hi> where <hi>Montroſs,</hi> conſidering that the Enemy might have intercepted the direct way to the Hills with his numerous Horſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Men to turn to the South-weſtward, and march with all imaginable ſpeed; by which artifice and incredible toil, he deluded his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers, ſlipping by them in the night; and wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly Northwards, he paſſed the <hi>Eſk</hi> not far from the Caſtle of <hi>Careſton.</hi> And having after ſome light Skirmiſhes, and a continued March of threeſcore Miles, without Sleep, without Meat, or any other refreſhment, gained the foot of the Mountains, the Enemy at length left them, retiring from their fruitleſs purſuit.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Being come into <hi>Fife,</hi> the richeſt and moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular <hi>Province</hi> of the Kingdom, he reſolved to paſs the <hi>Forth.</hi> Which he alſo did, four Miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Sterling;</hi> and marching forward, encamped at <hi>Kilſythe.</hi> The <hi>Rebels,</hi> fierce with their multitudes, thought that <hi>Montroſs</hi>'s late Marches, and his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty paſſing of the <hi>Forth,</hi> were the effects of his Fear, not Counſel. So that they reſolve to attack him in that place he had choſen; their chief care being, to cut off all Retreats, eſpecially to the Mountains. <hi>Montroſs</hi>'s Army, conſiſted of Four Thouſand Five Hundred Foot, and Five Hundred Horſe; the <hi>Rebels,</hi> of Six Thouſand Foot and Eight Hundred Horſe. But, their fortune the ſame; for, the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> animated by the rare Valour of the old Earl of <hi>Arley,</hi> who being ſixty years of age, did with his ſingle Troop defeat Three of the Enemy's, and diſ-engaged a Battalion of <hi>Montroſs</hi>'s Foot,<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſythe.</hi>
                           </note> too raſhly advanced; which gave ſuch uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Courage to the whole Army, that raiſing a great Shout, they all ran upon the Enemy, beat down ſuch as reſiſted, and ruined all, ſcarce One Hundred of the Foot eſcaping.

                        <p>Upon this, the <hi>Confederate</hi> Lords fled out of the Kingdom, and ſuch who favour'd the King, did no more ſcruple to diſcover themſelves.

                        <p>It is now high time to return to <hi>Holmbey,</hi> and take a view of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Diverſions in that wretched Solitude.

                        <p>The <hi>Rebels</hi> being now Maſters of the King and Kingdom, having ſupplanted the true Heir, were upon dividing the Inheritance. Nay, had gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral of their Grandees with ſplendid Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, when diſſenting amongſt themſelves, they by their own Diſcords, opened a paſſage to their deſerved ruine.

                        <p>The <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> to comply with their <hi>Scots</hi> Brethren, had aboliſhed the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and to keep <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> from reviving, had confiſcated all its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues. But, the Severity of this rigid Diſcipline, was not equally pleaſing to all, eſpecially to thoſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97792:82"/>who pretended <hi>New Light.</hi> Theſe blaming all Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranical Impoſitions in Holy Things, hold forth a <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> which permits every one <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> from another to ſerve God after his own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                        <p>This Doctrine was very pleaſing to the <hi>Common People,</hi> eſpecially the Souldiery, ſeeing it indulged them with Licentiouſneſs; which, not only the Vulgar, but their Officers did likewiſe embrace. So that the Fold of <hi>Preſbytery</hi> being thrown down, the ſtrayed Sheep were gathered under other <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,</hi> forming thereby the ſeveral Sects of <hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Millenaries,</hi> and the reſt. And, theſe were they, who under pretence of the <hi>Self-denying Ordinance,</hi> removed <hi>Eſſex</hi> and his Chief Officers from the Command of the Army, impoſing <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who though a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> was flexile, in his Room. To this Man, being of a melancholy and affected God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>Cromwell,</hi> by a particular Diſpenſation, was adjoined; who, by a feigned Sanctimony, ſhould lead him at Pleaſure. The Colonels and Captains, were likewiſe all <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> or ſuch who were not averſe to them.

Theſe and ſuch like Feats, being not perceived, or neglected by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who were far more numerous in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: But the Faction increaſing and growing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, by the Acceſſion of other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> they at length reſolved to obſerve them more narrowly. The Enemy now moſt formidable was the Army, fierce and high with their Victories. Theſe they fear, and therefore deſire to diſſolve them; which they not daring to attempt at once, they bethink themſelves how to diminiſh their Power and Pride. And a very plauſible Occaſion preſented it ſelf, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies being to be ſent into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Eleven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97792:83"/>were inſtantly voted for that Service; and, another <hi>Decree</hi> paſſed, for eaſing of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>

Theſe Votes however violent, were carried by <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Skill and Arts, who ceaſed not to aſſure them of the Souldiers Obedience and Submiſſion. Not, that he deſired the Army diſſolved, the thing in the World he apprehended moſt; but, that by that means the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as Chief Authors of thoſe odious Decrees, might be render'd more hateful to the Souldiers. Which happen'd accordingly; for, the News was no ſooner come to the Camp, but they began to mutiny, eſpecially being made believe, they were to be caſhier'd without their Arrears. They therefore take a Reſolution not to ſtir, and to try every Extremity rather than go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo far diſtant, to be deſtroyed with Sickneſs and Hunger; or indeed, to return to their Trades a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

The Surpriſal of the King being known at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> the <hi>Members</hi> there, hurried betwixt the Paſſions of Rage and Terror, were ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond; until raiſed by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who ſeeming to deteſt the Inſolencies of the Souldiers no leſs than his Colleagues, added, That if they thought fit to let him go to the Army, he promiſed with much Aſſeveration, that he would not only reduce the Regiments to their Duty, but would oblige the Souldiers to lay down their Arms at the Door of the <hi>Parliament-Houſe.</hi> The <hi>Fathers</hi> revived with theſe flouriſhes, greatly extol their Author. And there were amongſt them, who proclaiming the Actions which he had gloriouſly performed for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> judged him worthy a Statue of Gold, if he ſhould compoſe the ſeditious Diſturbances of the Army. By this Artifice, he got leave to go (though others were of another Opinion, and not obſcurely adviſed his Seiſure) whilſt he ſmiles at their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity. He immediately taking Horſe, flew with no ordinary Speed to the Camp, where he not only approved what the Souldiers had done, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubſcribed their <hi>Declarations, Petitions,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances.</hi> And, to ſhew of what Conſequence he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed

                        </p>
                        <p>The King was not uncivilly received by <hi>Fairfax,</hi> but was entertained by <hi>Cromwell</hi> with all the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Duty and Loyalty;<note place="margin">We is ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly civilly received in the Camp.</note> who pathetically expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Sorrow for his Misfortunes, did not ceaſe to profeſs, That the Army, doubtful of his Safety, had reſcued him out of the Captivity of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and that he would never lay down Arms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his <hi>Majeſty</hi> was reſtored to his Scepters, and his Friends to more equal Conditions. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all, as well Officers as Soldiers, did ſeem to deplore the Injuſtice and Extremity of his Fate; and particularly, that he had been excluded from the Converſation of his Friends, and as it were buried alive in his own Palace, by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his Adverſaries.

And to improve their Promiſes, his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, and the uſual Forms of Divine Service (a thing which he had greatly deſired, and the only Artifice to beget a Confidence in him, of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality) were permitted him at pleaſure. His Friends and Servants were likewiſe admitted to his Preſence, and Attendance; ſo that the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> were dazzl'd with the Luſtre of theſe Conceſſions. Nay more, he was indulged the Liberty of writing to the Queen; and, her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Meſſages, were in no wiſe interrupted. His Children had free Acceſs to their <hi>Royal</hi> Father, and moreover the ſick of the <hi>King's Evil,</hi> were without Difficulty ſuffered as formerly, to be touched by him. But, all this was precarious, being the Contrivance of thoſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97792:84"/>Impoſtors, the Father and Son in-law, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> not out of any Favour to the King, but that by his Acceſſion, they being paramount, might more ſecurely triumph over the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

                        <p>Upon the King's Arrival in the Camp, <hi>Fairfax</hi> not a little ſurprized, acquainted the <hi>Parliament</hi> with it, profeſſing, That it happened without his, or his Officers Knowledge. And truly, it is not incredible, but that this ſervile <hi>General</hi> might be ignorant of the Authors of ſo great an Attempt: it being alſo told him by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> that ſeeing the thing was done, it was adviſedly and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely enough performed; and, that this was the Opinion of the Army.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97792:90"/>earneſtneſs he endeavoured the compoſing of all things in a deſirable Peace, and gives juſt and unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reaſons, why he could not yield his Aſſent to the Four Dethroning Bills.</hi>

                           <hi>He therefore appeals to the whole World why, or how, he had deſerved to be thus uſed?

He further men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, his compliance with the Army and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests; as alſo, of what importance that was to them, and their often repeated Profeſſions and Engagements for his juſt Rights and Reſtitution. He finally inferred, If it was Peace they would have, He ſhewed them the way to it, to which he would contribute his utmoſt. Was it Plenty and Happineſs? They were the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Effects of Peace. Was it ſecurity? He that did wiſh, that all Men would forgive and forget like him, had offered the</hi> Militia <hi>for his time. Was it Liberty of Conſcience? He who wanted it, was moſt ready to give it. Was it the right Adminiſtration of Juſtice?

Which being evident by their late pernicious Votes, and that nothing but Slavery and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to be expected from theſe new Maſters, they reſolved to vindicate their Sovereign, and their Liberty, by the way of Arms. But,<note place="margin">They riſe in ſeveral Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> firſt they would try the way of <hi>Petitioning.</hi> The Men of <hi>Eſſex</hi> began; being followed by them of <hi>Surrey</hi>

                        <p>The firſt appearance of an Inſurrection, broke out in the City of <hi>London,</hi> being accidental, not upon the King's Accompt. The <hi>Parliament</hi> had piouſly voted down <hi>Holy-days,</hi> abrogating all the <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> having appointed one Day in every Month, in lieu of them, for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik Recreations. The Apprentices, as uſually, had met in ſome Numbers in <hi>Moor-Fields</hi> on the 9th. of <hi>April,</hi> to play and divert themſelves. But, this being <hi>Sunday,</hi> moved the Zeal of ſome precize <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Officers of the Trained-Bands, who with their Guards would force them away, but were themſelves routed by the Boys, with Stones and Clubs; who alſo took their Colours from them, and in a Childiſh Bravery, marching into the Streets, frighted <hi>Warner</hi> the then Mayor into his Houſe; and, taking away a <hi>Drake</hi> from his Door, Planted it at <hi>Lud-Gate</hi> neareſt the Foe, the Army, then about <hi>White-Hall.</hi> But, <hi>Fairfax</hi> on the Morrow following, ent'ring with ſome Regiments of Horſe and Foot at <hi>Alderſ-Gate,</hi> eaſily diſperſed them, though then numerous, no Perſon of Quality undertaking their Conduct.</p>
                        <p>The Fame of this tumultuous Inſurrection, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Riot, was quickly noiſed throughout the Kingdom, which although ſtrangled in its Infancy, ſeemed to animate the oppreſſed populace to follow
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97792:91"/>the Example; whereby they might redeem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Liberties from their impending ſlavery. The <hi>Welch</hi> were the firſt that took up Arms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of Major General <hi>Laughorn,</hi>

But now, being to be disbanded by Orders of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War</hi> of the Army, they refuſe to obey. And, the better to ſecure themſelves, declare for the King, acting by Commiſſion and Powers from the then <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales. Laughorn</hi> grew ſuddenly by the acceſſion of Major General <hi>Stradling,</hi> and others of the King's Party to a conſiderable Army, eſteemed Eight Thouſand ſtrong, which rendered him Maſter of the Town and Caſtles of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Tenby.</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Kemiſh,</hi> at the ſame time ſurprized <hi>Chepſtow</hi> Caſtle; and, Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> another eminent Cavalier in <hi>North wales,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and took the High-Sheriff of <hi>Caernarvan.</hi> So that all <hi>Wales,</hi> ſeemed at once to ſhake off that cruel Yoak they laboured under.</p>
                        <p>Nor were the preparatives for a War of the <hi>Kentiſh-men,</hi> leſs conſiderable. For,<note place="margin">As alſo the <hi>Kentiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

                        <p>Upon the firſt noiſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> arming, many <hi>Engliſh</hi> repaired into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which obliged them at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by their Deputies, to require the delivery of the chief of them as Incendiaries.

                        <p>Theſe Revolts and Preparations for a new War, did ſtrangely diſquiet the pretended <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> who thereupon reviving their Votes of 1642. declare, <hi>That it appears, that the King ſeduced by wicked Counſel</hi> (though then a cloſe Priſoner) <hi>intends to make War againſt the Parliament.</hi>

                        <p>Two Days after, the King, the <hi>Beſt of Princes,</hi> was again brought before theſe <hi>Worſt of Rebels,</hi> his Judges; Where the <hi>Preſident,</hi> upon the Solicitor's Motion, requires <hi>his Poſitive Anſwer again, or elſe the Charge may be taken</hi> pro Confeſſo. He added, <hi>That this</hi> Court <hi>was fully ſatisfied with their Authority, which he alſo ought to acquieſce in, and therefore they yet again required, his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Anſwer, by confeſſing or denying it. If the later, Witneſſes were at hand in behalf of the Nation, to make good the Charge againſt him.</hi> To this the King ſaid, <hi>If it were his own particular Caſe, he would have ſatisfied himſelf with the Proteſtation he had made againſt the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97792:102"/>of the</hi> Court, <hi>and by demonſtrating, that the King of</hi> England, <hi>cannot be tryed by any Superiour Juriſdiction upon Earth. But it not being his Caſe alone, but the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Property of the People, he muſt ſtand for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. For, if an illegitimate Power, might make and break the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom at Pleaſure, no Man could be ſecure of his Life or Goods. He did expect Reaſons to know by what Law, what Authority they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt him; but, hearing none, he would produce his, with as much brevity as he could.</hi> But, he was interrupted here, the <hi>Preſident</hi> telling him, <hi>They muſt ſuffer no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, concerning the Authority of the</hi> Court, <hi>nor hear any Reaſoning againſt it. The Votes of the</hi> Commons <hi>in</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>were the Reaſon of the Kingdom, not to be queſtioned by any; to which alſo, he, and his Predeceſſors, were always obnoxions and reſponſible.</hi> This being denyed by the King; he further denyed, <hi>That the</hi> Commons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>were ever a</hi> Court of Judicature.

                        </p>
                        <p>The King had deſigned to deliver his Reaſons in writing againſt the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Court.</hi> But, it was not permitted, the <hi>Preſident,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He would admit nothing againſt the</hi> Parliament, <hi>from which there was no appeal.</hi> And ſo, the King was remitted, and the <hi>Court</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed.</p>
                        <p>Three Days after, the King was again brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Impious <hi>Court,</hi> where <hi>He deſired the</hi> Preſident (cloathed now in Scarlet, ſuitable to the Bloody Deſign of the Day) <hi>to be heard a Word, hoping to give no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of interruption.</hi> But, the <hi>Preſident</hi> refuſed him, ſaying, The <hi>Court</hi> muſt be firſt heard. And thereupon told the Auditors, how <hi>the Priſoner had been ſeveral times convented, and brought before the</hi> Court, <hi>to make Anſwer to a Charge of Treaſon, and other Crimes. Which he not only refuſed to do, but took upon him, to offer Reaſonings and Debates againſt the Authority of the</hi> Court, <hi>and the</hi> Higheſt Court <hi>that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97792:103"/>them to try and judge him; which being conſidered, as</hi> alſo his <hi>Contumacy, and the Probability of the Fact, they had reſolved to pronounce Sentence againſt him. But, the Priſoner deſiring to be firſt heard, the</hi> Court <hi>was content to hear him, provided he ſaid nothing againſt the Authority thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The King then ſaid, <hi>Since they would hear nothing of Debate, concerning what he thought moſt material for the Peace of the Kingdom, he would wave it; only tell them, That all Things had been taken from him this many a Day, but what he valued dearer than his Life, his</hi> Conſcience <hi>and his</hi> Honour. <hi>And, if he had reſpect to his Life more than the Peace of the Kingdoms, and the Liberty of the Subject, certainly he would have made a Particular Defence for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whereby he might have at leaſt delayed an ugly Sentence, which he believed would paſs upon him. And therefore, if his Zeal to his Country, had not overborn the Care that he had of his own Preſervation, he ſhould have gone another Way to Work. He conceived, That a haſty Sentence once paſſed, might be ſooner repented of, than recalled. And, the ſame deſire that he had for the Peace of the Kingdom and the Liberty of the Subject, more than his own particular, did make him now at laſt deſire, that having ſomething to to ſay that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns both, he might be heard in the</hi> Painted-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>before the</hi> Lords <hi>and</hi> Commons. <hi>This delay could not be prejudical to them, whatſoever he ſaid. If Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it would be worth the Hearing; if otherwiſe, thoſe who heard him might judge. He therefore conjured them, as they loved what they pretended, the Liberty of the Subject, and Peace of the Kingdom, that they would grant him a Hearing before Sentence paſt. If not, he did protest, that ſo fair ſhews of Liberty and Peace, were but meer ſhews, and not otherwiſe; and, that they would not hear their King.</hi>

                        <p>After ſome ſhort Prayers, he ſubmitted his Head to the Axe; an unheard of, and ſurprizing Example of Human Fragility.

The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants</hi> ſaid, <hi>That they only put to Death, a Private Man, and an Enemy. The King had been long ſince killed by the</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>as being deſpoiled of his</hi> Prerogative, <hi>whereby he excelled others; of the</hi> Militia, <hi>wherewith he protected his Subjests; and, of his</hi> Freedom of Vote, <hi>whereby he made Laws.</hi> They alſo remembred, <hi>How he had been divested and robbed of his</hi> Liberty, <hi>as a</hi> Commoner; <hi>of the Society of his Wife, as a</hi> Husband; <hi>of the Converſation of his Children, as a</hi> Parent; <hi>of the Attendance of his Servants, as a</hi> Maſter: <hi>Yea, of every Thing that might render his Life comfortable. So, that there was nothing left for the</hi> Independants <hi>to do, but to put an end to the Calamities, wherewith this</hi> Man of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>had been ſo cruelly overwhelmed and afflicted
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97792:107"/>by the</hi> Presbyterians. But, who ever were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this Impiety, we grieve at what they did; which, ſeeing it cannot be undone, we may wiſh, that the Memory of it may periſh, with them who deſigned and perpetrated ſo Helliſh a Miſchief.</p>
                        <p>Nor had the <hi>Scelerates</hi> of the <hi>Faction,</hi> yet ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Cruelty. They were inhumanly bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous to his Dead <hi>Corps.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanities after his Death.</note> His <hi>Hair</hi> and his <hi>Blood</hi> were ſold by Parcels.

Which were greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought, but, for different Ends; by ſome, as Trophies of their ſlain Enemy, and by others, as precious Reliques of their beloved Prince. It is certain, that <hi>Cromwell,</hi> to ſatisfy his greedy Eyes, had cauſed the Coffin to be opened in <hi>White-Hall;</hi> and, did with his Fingers ſearch the-Wound, as if he had ſtill doubted of the effecting of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Cruelty. Nor did it ſuffice, to have raged againſt him living, and dead; they will alſo, for as much as in them lies, kill his very Fame. Which they endeavoured to do, by the enſlaved Pen of a needy <hi>Pedagogue,</hi> one <hi>Milton. Salmaſius</hi> indeed had writ a Defence for the King; but, he being a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> as the other an <hi>Independant, both very good</hi> Latin (if we believe the Learned <hi>Hobbs</hi>) <hi>and hardly to be judged which is better; and, both very ill Reaſoning, and hardly to be judged which is worſt.</hi>

They made him great indeed; great in Suffering, in Patience,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> and great in his <hi>Martyrdom.</hi> Thus fell <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Juſt, Monarch</hi> of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97792:107"/>Three flouriſhing Kingdoms. A great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if any, of both <hi>Fortunes. The Beſt of Kings, The Meekeſt of Men.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97792:116"/>the <hi>South</hi> ſide of the City; and, that he might wholly ſhut up the Enemy, and particularly their Horſes and Cattel from grazing, he commanded a Fort to be built at <hi>Baggot-rath,</hi> giving the Charge of this conſiderable Truſt to <hi>Patrick-Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, Major General</hi> of the Army. Some Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>England</hi> were in the mean time Landed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Venables,</hi> to the Number of Three Thouſand Horſe and Foot; whereupon, a Rumor was ſpread, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> himſelf deſigned for <hi>Munſter,</hi> as not yet confirmed in their Defection from their late Maſters.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:97792:116"/>a very great Victory. For, the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſudden ſurprized, with a more than Panick Fear, the Souldiers forgetful of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, threw down their Arms and ran away.

The Cannon, the Camp, and the immenſe Spoils of it, ſell to the preſent ſharing of the Conquerors; and, preſently after, the whole Kingdom, the Forces of it being irrecoverably loſt by this Blow. <hi>Ormond</hi> who had ſpent the Night on Horſeback in rounding and viewing the ſeveral Poſts of the Army, being but newly laid to reſt, was raiſed, by the coming of the <hi>Lord Taffe,</hi> General of the Ordnance, but too late, the Camp being diſtracted with Fear, and its Conſequence, Confuſion.

                        <p>But, as if theſe Misfortunes had been but light ones, they were followed by a grievous Plague, brought to <hi>Gallowav</hi> by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſel; which raged with that Fury, that it ſwept away many Thouſands in that City, and the Neighbouring Country.

                           <hi>Dublin</hi> with an Army of Fifteen Thouſand, Horſe and Foot.

                           </note> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> will triumph for another's Victory. Having refreſhed and muſtered his Army, he marched with it to <hi>Tredah.</hi> This Town was well fortifyed, and a Garriſon in it of Two Thouſand Five Hundred Foot and Three Hundred Horſe, the Flower of the Royal Army, under the command of Sir <hi>Arthur Aſton,</hi> a brave and experienced Souldier. The <hi>Lord Lieutenant</hi> had foreſeen, that this Place, by reaſon of its Neighbourhood and Situation, would be firſt attempted; it not being adviſable in the Enemy, to leave ſo conſiderable a Fortreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. And, he hoped he might have time to recruit his ſhattered Army, and repair the Loſs of his late Overthrow, which he endeavoured with all his Might, whilſt <hi>Cromwell</hi> was employed in the difficulties of the Siege. But, this impatient Conqueror, omitting the common Forms of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching and turnings, fell to battering, and made two acceſſible Breaches in the Walls, which were Twice bravely aſſaulted, and Twice no leſs vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly defended, the Enemy being as often repelled; until reinforced by <hi>Cromwell's</hi> preſence and conduct, renewing the Storm, having ſlain <hi>Collonel Wall</hi> in the Breach, they at length entered. A tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offer of Quarter being made, and accepted ſooner than it ought to have been, was the Ruine of the Defendants, and, by their incautious Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of the whole Garriſon: For, the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus taken, they were all put to the Sword; though they did not fall unrevenged, for they fought in every Street, the Market-place, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97792:117"/>from the Houſes and Towers whither they had retreated. <hi>Aſhton</hi> the Governour, withdrew into the Caſtle, where the Enemy entring Pell-Mell with his Men, ſlew him. Others who fled into a Tower, imploring the Enemies Clemency,<note place="margin">

Nor would they ſuffer this magnanimous Prince, to ſtay in the Camp, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the danger of his Perſon; but more truly, leſt, as it appeared in that Encounter, he ſhould gain too much upon the Souldiers Favours, and thereby render himſelf Maſter of that Army, which had been raiſed by the auſpicious Influence of his Name.</p>
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:97792:123"/>
                        <p>There were Three prevalent Factions in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at that Time. The Firſt and Greateſt, was that of the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Kirk,</hi> which would indeed have a King, but precarious, and one who ſhould govern as they directed. Another Faction, was of the moſt rigid <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> Theſe dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of I know not what <hi>Theocracy</hi> or Government by the Church, equally abhorr'd both King and Commonwealth as profane. But this, upon the Defeat of <hi>Straugham</hi> and <hi>Kerr</hi> by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſhed. The Third was, that of the <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> but unarmed, and excluded from Publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; to which the King was forced to retire, in Expectation of better Times.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the mean time, raiſed with ſome ſmall Succeſſes, as the taking of <hi>Collington,</hi> and <hi>Red-Houſe</hi> by ſtorm, endeavoured to draw the <hi>Scots</hi> to Battle. They approached their Camp; ſeemed careleſly to wander under their Trenches; and with the contumely of Words, daily dared them to fight; but in vain, for the <hi>Scots</hi> were fixt not to adventure the Hazard of a Battle, but to overcome the Enemy without Danger, with Hunger, Cold, Sickneſſes, and the Rigor of the Climate. <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſeeing then he could not force the <hi>Scots,</hi> by reaſon of the Situation of their Camp, nor oblige them to fight out of it; his Proviſions being likewiſe ſpent, he determined to bring his Army back to <hi>Dunbar;</hi> which he alſo did, tho not without much Difficulty by reaſon of the cloſe purſuit of the <hi>Scots.</hi> From thence he reſolved to return with what haſte he could, with his ſick and weary Forces, by Sea or Land, for <hi>England;</hi> for, he deſpaired of any Hopes of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this inauſpicious Expedition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dunbar</hi> is a Sea Town, ſeated betwixt <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Berwick,</hi> ſurrounded on the Land ſide with Mountains and Precipices; which are likewiſe ſo
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97792:124"/>ſteep, that there is but one paſſage at <hi>Copperſpeith,</hi> ſcarce large enough for Ten Men a-breſt, which was alſo poſſeſſed by the Enemy, who now inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bragged (which they might alſo have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if <hi>God</hi> had not infatuated their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,) That they had the Army of the <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> in a Pound.</p>
                        <p>And thus this ſo famous a <hi>Leader,</hi> had brought his Army, by ill Conduct, into ſuch Streights; that all his Glory got by ſo many Victories, had vaniſh'd in Infamy, if Fortune and the Follies of his Enemies, had not contributed to his Relief. For, it would have proved a buſineſs of extreme Difficulty, to have ſhipt his Men, they preſſing ſo near upon him: nor would it have been leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to return by Land, all the Paſſages and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues being guarded by an Enemy ſo numerous, and much more healthful, as being in the Clime they firſt breathed in. They were Twice as many as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and hovered like a Cloud upon the Hills about them. But, their Impatience to overcome, loſt them the Victory; for, wheeling to the Right, they, in Confidence of their Strength, deſcended into the Plain, as if they deſigned to deprive them of all Hopes of Retreating. <hi>Cromwell</hi> perceiving this, as if he had cooped himſelf up, but with Deſign to break out with more Luſtre, ſent <hi>Lambert</hi> with Six Regiments of Horſe and Three of Foot, to charge them. He was bravely received at firſt; but afterwards, by the Fatal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Deſpair, routed the adverſe Cavalry. The Foot ſeeing their Horſe broke without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ran alſo away, in vain ſeeking that Safety in their Legs, which they had had in their Hands. And thus, a very great Victory was gained by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in a Moment, wherein Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were ſlain, and near Ten Thouſand taken; Two Hundred Colours, Fifteen Thouſand Arms, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97792:124"/>the whole ſpoil of the Camp, with the Loſs of ſcarce Three Hundred <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor did this ſignal Victory, which made them Maſters of the South ſide of the <hi>Frith,</hi> coſt them any more: For, it being known at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> by the Arrival of <hi>Leſley</hi> who fled with the Horſe, the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Souldiery</hi> quitted that City, as alſo <hi>Leeth,</hi> a commodious Station for ſhipping, and poſted away to <hi>Sterling,</hi> leaving all except the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to the Diſpoſal of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</p>
                        <p>This Battle ſeemed indifferent to the King, who could loſe none but Enemies, whoever vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were no leſs averſe to him, than the <hi>Independants;</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> if they had overcome, would have uſed him no better, than they did his Auguſt Father at <hi>New-Caſtle:</hi> They had extorted Conditions from him, equal to thoſe their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brethren had forced from his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred Predeceſſor in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight.</hi> Nor did thoſe Conceſſions ſuffice; ſomewhat was ſtill ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added and obtruded upon him. And, as if that were not enough, he himſelf, as alſo his Friends, were excluded from ſharing in the Government. He had no command in the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho all its Forces were raiſed in his Name. And, even now, their Army being loſt, they did not ceaſe, unſeaſonably to torment this excellent Prince with their Impertinencies. They impoſe new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon him; pretend to reform his Family; and endeavour to extort a Declaration from him, againſt himſelf, and ſuch who were faithful to him. Provoked with theſe inſufferable Indignities, and with the Impatience of bearing with their rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated Follies, he withdrew himſelf privately our of their Guardianſhip; and, taking Horſe, under pretence of taking the Air in his Shoes and Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, he rode towards the Provinces of the <hi>North,</hi>
                           <pb n="242" facs="tcp:97792:125"/>where the <hi>Atholians</hi> and the <hi>Guordons</hi> expected him in Arms. It is incredible, how unworthily he had been uſed ſince his firſt Arrival in <hi>Scotland.</hi> It may not be impertinent, to mention ſome of thoſe barbarous Paſſages. In his way from <hi>Spey</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ſome of the Towns did not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his happy Arrival with their Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but with their Preſents alſo. <hi>Aberdene</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed Fifteen Hundred Pounds upon him; which the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> took ſo ill, that to prevent the Liberality of the other Towns, they commanded, <hi>That ſuch who had Money to laviſh away, ſhould bring it into the Treaſury.</hi> Cautioning hereby, that the People ſhould not demonſtrate their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their Prince, or the Prince be ſenſible of the good Will of his Subjects towards himſelf. Yet more; when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parricides had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached them with their Agreement with their King, they declared, They would not own his Cauſe, until he acknowledged and repented his own Sins, the Tranſgreſſions of his Father, and the Idolatry of his Mother. By all which, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That his Majeſty was now in the ſame Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, his Royal Father had formerly been, in the Hands of the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But, the Parliament ſeriouſly conſidering the King's Receſs, and perceiving their own inevitable Ruin at Hand, if they perſiſted in their Obſtinacy and Follies, they ſent <hi>Montgomery</hi> with a choice Party of Horſe after his Majeſty, humbly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his Return. Which he alſo effected, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of better Conditions for the future; which were alſo performed, the Grandees being much mollified by their late Overthrow. And, now the King was admitted, as concerned, in the Publick Tranſactions; tho the Miniſters mainly oppoſed it, not yet ſenſible of the imminent Deſtruction,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:97792:125"/>which threatned the continuance of their Diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Feuds.</p>
                        <p>The King now at the Helm, Orders were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out for new Levies; his Friends were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Publick Employments; and he was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with as much Pomp and Magnificence, as the Troubles would permit, at <hi>Scone.</hi> And now, the Minds of the moſt Seditious being in ſome ſort appeaſed, the King's <hi>Standard</hi> was ſet up at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen;</hi> and, all who were fit to bear Arms, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to take them up againſt their invading Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the King is buſied in raiſing Forces, <hi>Cromwell</hi> was no leſs intent in Proſecution of his Victory. <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> opened their Gates to him. And the Caſtle annexed to the City (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable in it ſelf by reaſon of its Situation) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no long ſiege was ſurrend'red to him. He took alſo all the Fortreſſes, by himſelf or Liuetenants, on this ſide the <hi>Frith;</hi> ſo that the King ſolicitous for <hi>Sterling,</hi> encamped under the Walls of it. He removed thence to <hi>Torwood;</hi> where being well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched, he ſlighted the Provocations and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Enemy, reſolving to hazard nothing, before his new Levies, which were raiſing for him in the Northern Counties, were come up to him.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the Two Armies were thus in fight of each other, a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot was diſcovered, which was detected by I know not what Letters found in a Ship at <hi>Ayre.</hi> The Deſign was formed by their <hi>Parſons</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> who expecting a choice Body of Horſe from <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Maſſey,</hi> pretended to raiſe ſome conſiderable Diſturbances in Abſence of the Army. But, the Secret being laid open, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gibbons,</hi> for Terror to others, were by <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation both heheaded.</p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:97792:126"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cromwell,</hi> when he ſaw he could neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke nor compel the King to fight, impatient of Delay, he commanded <hi>Col. Overton</hi> to attempt a Paſſage into <hi>Fife;</hi> which he did, with Fourteen Hundred Foot, and Four Troops of Horſe. And after ſome light Skirmiſhes, landing at <hi>North-Ferry,</hi> he immediately caſt up ſome Works for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, where he alſo contained himſelf until more Succors came. Which quickly happened; for, <hi>Lambert</hi> flying to his Aid with Two Regiments of Horſe, and as many of Foot, they fought and defeated <hi>Browne,</hi> who was ſent thither by the King with near Four Thouſand Men. Him they ſlew, and kill'd and took well nigh all the <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</hi> Whilſt this was in Action, <hi>Cromwell</hi> braved it before the King's Trenches, and ſeemed to deſign to aſſault them; but, hearing of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he marched back with his Army; and, paſſing the <hi>Forth,</hi> joined the reſt of his Victorious Forces; and, marching with ſpeed to St. <hi>Johnſtone,</hi> after having drained the Mote and planted his Cannon, he had the Place delivered to him without any further Reſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>The King, who had long ſince deſigned to march into <hi>England,</hi> is now neceſſitated to do it, and to transfer the War into <hi>England,</hi> which he was not in a Condition to ſupport in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Hearing therefore of the Siege of St. <hi>Johnſtone,</hi> whilſt the Rebels were buſied there, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves his Camp with ſwift Marches towards <hi>England;</hi> permitting all ſuch, who were diſſatisfied with the preſent State of Affairs, to depart at pleaſure. Many, eſpecially of the Faction of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile</hi> and the <hi>Kirk,</hi> leaving him, he led the Reſt, now entirely at his Command, along with him. <hi>Cromwell</hi> being informed of the King's Departure, ſent his Horſe after him; and having left <hi>Monk</hi> behind him, with Six Thouſand Men, to finiſh
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97792:126"/>the Reliques of the War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> follows with the Strength of his Army, whilſt the reſt of his Forces which guarded the Borders, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to hinder the King's Advance. The <hi>Rump</hi> terrified with the Rumour of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, condemned <hi>Cromwell</hi> of Temerity and Precipitation; but, raiſed with his Letters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Defence. And, leſt the Provinces wearied with their Tyranny, ſhould look back towards their Lawful Prince, they fill them with their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Troops, forcing the Trained Bands of the Counties, to joyn with them againſt the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Scots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The King's Army not exceeding 12000 Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Men, had entred <hi>England;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">July. 1. 1651.</note> and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Harriſons</hi> Interruption with their numerous Cavalry, joyning with the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Darby</hi> out of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> forced their Paſſage at <hi>Warrington-Bridge;</hi> and continuing their March through the thick Squadrons of the Enemy, and the Oppoſition of frequent Encounters, came at Length to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> a City affectionate to His Majeſty's Service. The King left the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Derby</hi> behind him in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to raiſe new Forces. But, this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſonage, however great in Reputation in that Country, had ſcarce got Fifteen Hundred Men together, when he was attacked by <hi>Collonel Lilbourne</hi> with far greater Numbers; and, being unequel to thoſe Veteranes, after a ſharp Fight, he was defeated by them. And, however he eſcaped their preſent Fury by Flight; he was afterwards taken in the Battel of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and being brought to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> was there, notwithſtanding the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given him, beheaded by the <hi>Regicides;</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his Courſe with no leſs Gallantry, than he had lived with Glory.</p>

                        <p>The King upon his Entry into <hi>England,</hi> was ploclaimed by a Herald at Arms, King of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, SCOTLAND, FRANCE and IRELAND; which was alſo done in all the chief Towns as he paſſed along, and was now repeated at <hi>Worceſter</hi> with greater Pomp and Splendour. He had by Letters and Meſſages in his March, invited ſeveral of the Rebel-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Governours to the return of their Duty, but in vain. He had alſo deſired the ſame of the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Common-Council</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> but with the ſame ſucceſs. There were, however, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Noble Perſons who came in to him, as, the <hi>Lord Talbot, Packington, Howard, Broughton,</hi> and others, with about Two Thouſand private Souldiers. The reſt kept back, either ſurprized with the ſudden Advance of the King, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently unprovided; or terrified with the Cruelty of the <hi>Rump,</hi> and ſo durſt not appear; or averſe to the <hi>Scots,</hi> now unſeaſonably mindful of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Injuries received from them, and would not come.</p>
                        <p>The King had been adviſed, and it was his own Opinion, to march from <hi>Warrington</hi> directly to <hi>London,</hi> which in probability ought to have been done, if the Army had not been ſo much wearied with their former Toyles and Labours. They therefore came to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> a Place convenient enough; where having recovered, and repaired their Strength, they might either expect or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the War. Hither <hi>Cromwell</hi> came Six Days after, with the conjoyned Forces of the Party, amounting to near Sixty Thouſand Souldiers and Trained-Bands, and having beaten <hi>Maſſey</hi> from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton-Bridge,</hi> approached the Town. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> having paſſed the Rivers <hi>Severne</hi> and <hi>Tame,</hi> upon Bridges and Boats, advance towards the Walls, however very bravely oppoſed by the <hi>Scots,</hi>
                           <pb n="247" facs="tcp:97792:127"/>out of the Hedges and Ditches in their way. But, the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> being out-numbered, were forced to retreat towards the City. The <hi>Rebels</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed and wounded <hi>Montgomery</hi> at <hi>Powick, Cromwell</hi> advancing, drew up near ..... <hi>Wood.</hi> The King with <hi>Forbes</hi>'s Foot, a ſmall Body of Horſe, (for <hi>Leſley</hi> with Two Thouſand more ſtood a loof of, and did not approach) and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Voluntiers, charged the <hi>Van</hi> of the Enemy with ſo much intrepid Bravery, that he not only repelled them, but took their Cannon; which yet he could not keep by reaſon of their numerous Reſerves, and Supplies inceſſantly relieving each other: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the King having performed all the Parts of a Great Commander, by rallying his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Troops, and embodying his ſcattered Foot, and encouraging them by his Example and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in their renewed Encounters, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pow'red by the adverſe Legions, Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> who kept cloſe to him, being alſo wounded (of which Hurt he ſhortly died) he was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat towards the City, which he entered on Foot at <hi>Sudbury-Gate,</hi> being then obſtructed by a laden Waggon overthrown in the Paſſage. Nor did he long ſtay there, but mounting another Horſe, when he ſaw all was loſt, and that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy entered on all ſides, he at length, ſlipping away in the Croud, eſcaped out of the City. The <hi>Royal-Fort,</hi> defended by <hi>Col. Drummund</hi> with Fifteen Hundred Men, was taken by Aſſault, where all were put to the Sword.

                           <hi>Ireton</hi> having been left by his Father-in-law to command in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he began with the Siege of <hi>Waterford.</hi> Which <hi>Preſton,</hi> who commanded there, ſeemed reſolved to defend; until, finding himſelf ſhut up with Approaches, and Trenches, and attacked with the adverſe Cannon; but, above all, ſeeing no hopes of Relief, he ſurrendered this ſtrong City, upon Articles of Indemnity for the Inhabitants, and Liberty for the Garriſon to march away with their Colours and Arms. <hi>Carlaw</hi> and <hi>Duncan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> ran the ſame Fate at the ſame Time, Young <hi>Preſton</hi> marching away with the Souldiers of thoſe Fortreſſes. All this while, the <hi>Confederates</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their unhappy Diſſenſions, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Reformed</hi> teazing each other with their wild and unſeaſonable Controverſies. No due reſpect or obedience were paid to the Lord Lieutenant. And now, the <hi>Clergy</hi> endeavoured to diſtract the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> amongſt themſelves, animated parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly againſt <hi>Ormond;</hi> whom they labour with Calumnies to ſeparate from <hi>Inchequin,</hi> and him again by the ſame Arts from his <hi>Excellency.</hi> The furious Heat of ſome of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> grew to that height, that impatient of the Government of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> they pronounced it abrogated; excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating all ſuch, who dared to diſobey their Dictates. <hi>Ormond</hi> having tried all ways to allay theſe fatal Differences, and perſwade them to unite for their Common Defence, to no purpoſe; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their Obſtinacy, he reſolved to quit them, leſt he might be involved in their Ruine. To theſe Indignities, they of <hi>Limerick</hi> beſieged on one ſide by <hi>Ireton,</hi> refuſed him Entrance on the other, though he came with Forces to their Aſſiſtance, under pretence, <hi>That they themſelves ſufficed for their own Defence.</hi> And yet, leſt the King's Affairs, might ſuffer by their Folly and his Abſence, he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97792:129"/>gave the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Caſtel-haven</hi> the Command of the Forces; and, by the Suffrages of all, conſtituted the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Clanrickard, Deputy</hi> of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Clanrickard</hi> having undertaken the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more to delay the Rebels Conqueſt, than out of any Appearance of Succeſs, in hopes it might advantage the King upon his march out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> makes new Levies; recruits the Veteranes; provides Warlike Inſtruments; and, being power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſiſted by the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> endeavours to repair the lapſed condition of their Party: Not, that he thereby fancied the Recovery of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but, to give the King Time to try the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of a Day with <hi>Cromwell,</hi> as His Majeſty had himſelf inculcated to him by his Letters. Nor were the Forces he raiſed contemptible, amounting to Five Thouſand; but, by the continual Averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fortune, they effected nothing of moment. They indeed took ſome ſmall Garriſons of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s, he being gone to his <hi>Winter</hi>-Quarters; but, being aſſaulted by <hi>Collonel Axtel</hi> in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Milech,</hi> and their Trenches forced, they were broken, Five Hundred at leaſt of them being ſlain and drown'd. The Reſidue attempting no further, ſecured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Connaught,</hi> interpoſing the River S..... and the <hi>Curluvian</hi> Mountains, betwixt them and this Fortunate Enemy; guarding the Paſſages and Avenues of that Province, the only thing they were now capable of. Nor could they long ſecure themſelves there; for, the <hi>Spring</hi> advancing, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> took the Field; and, having ſent for <hi>Coot</hi> out of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> to meet him, he <hi>(Coot)</hi> under Pretence of beſieging <hi>Slego,</hi> thereby diverted the Enemies Forces, paſſing the <hi>Colluvian.</hi> Mountains, whilſt the other got over the <hi>Shannon</hi> at <hi>Killalo,</hi> by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery or Cowardiſe of Collonel <hi>Fenel,</hi> appointed to guard it.

Limerick,</hi> however ſtrong, weakened with their own Diſſenſions, did not reſiſt ſo long as it might have done, being well garriſoned and well victuall'd; but delivered it ſelf, the Garriſon marching away without their Arms, leaving Four and Twenty of the Principal in it to Mercy. Of theſe, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Firne,</hi> and ſeveral others active in the firſt Part of the Rebellion, were hanged. Nor was this Victory leſs fatal to the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> who did not long ſurvive it, being extinguiſhed by the <hi>Plague.</hi> This <hi>Monſter,</hi> having been bred up in the Law, whereof he had ſome ſmatterings, had been largely imbibed from his Youth, in the Frantick Ravings of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> Which <hi>Cromwell</hi> obſerving, as alſo his Ingenuity, took him into his Fellowſhip, and Family; and matching him to his Daughter, made him his Son-in-law. He was active, vigilant, and ſtedfaſt; nor impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Council or Execution in War; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, a chief Champion and Contriver in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable <hi>Regicide.</hi>

                           <hi>Ireton</hi> being dead, the chief Command of the Army, was at preſent devolved upon <hi>Ludlowe,</hi> a Man bold and daring, to whom Three more Collegues were afterwards aſſociated. In the mean time, <hi>Galloway</hi> was ſurrendered, <hi>Clanrickard</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving articled for Permiſſion to depart. Neither was any more warring there ſave againſt ſome, Mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and <hi>Tories,</hi> the Garriſons every where opening their Gates; and, the Souldiery yet in Arms, having conditioned their Tranſportation, paſſed moſt of them into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service in <hi>Flanders;</hi> a <hi>Militia,</hi> not much more Fortunate than their own. <hi>Ireland</hi> being ſubdued, all vailed to the Conquerors. <hi>General Monk,</hi> after <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Departure, beſieges <hi>Sterling,</hi> which however filled with Arms, Cannon, Proviſions in Abundance, and the Records, and Monuments of their Kings, was tamely ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:97792:130"/>to him <hi>Dundee,</hi> by the Valour of <hi>Luniſdane</hi> the <hi>Governour,</hi> held out; but, being over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was taken by Aſſault, and the whole Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon put to the Sword. The ſlaughter was cruel, and the Town no leſs unmercifully pillaged by the covetous Souldiers; which ſtruck ſuch a Terror in others, that <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Garriſons, that they might not be involved in ſo ruinous a Fate, prevented it by a timely Rendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>Phillip Muſgrave</hi> had attempted to raiſe new Forces in <hi>Galloway,</hi> ſo did alſo a Convention of ſome of the <hi>Nobility</hi> at <hi>Ellit:</hi> but, being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Leven</hi> and <hi>Crawford, Ogelby, Muſgrave,</hi> and others, were taken Priſoners. The <hi>Scots</hi> made yet one Attempt more under <hi>Midle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Huntley, Glencarne,</hi> and other <hi>Highlanders;</hi> but, they alſo were ſuppreſt by the Valour and Vigilancy of <hi>Col. Morgan.</hi> There was no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my more that appeared; and, to take all hopes of embodying from them for the future, Four ſtrong Cittadels were built in Four principal Parts of the Country, <hi>viz. Leith, Ayre, Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and St. <hi>Johnſtons.</hi> And now, <hi>Scotland</hi> being ſufficiently ſubjugated, was ſubjected to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and incorporated into one <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> with that Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>During theſe Traverſes, Sir <hi>John Greenvil</hi> had detained ſome Merchant Ships belonging to the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Scylly;</hi> which ſo irritated the <hi>States,</hi> that they ſent <hi>Tromp</hi> with Twelve Men of War to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, or require ſatisfaction for the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. He had alſo Inſtructions, to treat with the Governour for the Surrendry of that Place into their Hands; but, the Secret was not carried ſo cloſe, but that theſe Tranſactions were known to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who thereupon ſent <hi>Blake</hi> with a Fleet to hinder the Alienation of ſo Important a Place,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:97792:131"/>by reaſon of its exceeding Commodiouſneſs for Navigation. <hi>Greenvil</hi> being thus aſſaulted on both ſides, choſe rather to deliver the <hi>Iſles</hi> to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, than Strangers; preſuming, that being annexed to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> they might by that means be one Day, together with it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the <hi>Crown</hi> again. He therefore, upon very honourable Conditions, ſurrenders that <hi>Poſt</hi> he could not preſerve longer, having the King's Permiſſion for it; and will in the cloſe of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, grow eminently illuſtrious, for his Services in the Reſtauration of his <hi>Sacred Majesty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>About that Time, the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the Richeſt of our <hi>Weſtern Plantations,</hi> was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to Sir <hi>George Ayſcue.</hi> He had for ſome Months hovered with a Fleet about thoſe Coaſts, until the Inhabitants, deſtracted with their Inteſtine Diſſenſions, obliged the <hi>Lord Willoughby,</hi> the Governour, to deliver it up; which he did, upon very good Terms for himſelf, and the <hi>Iſlanders:</hi> being alſo followed by the Subjection of the reſt of our <hi>Occidental Colonies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Rebels</hi> had long ſince been Maſters of <hi>Garnſey,</hi> except the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> ſituate in the Sea, and defended for ſeveral Years (being relieved by ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from <hi>France,</hi> and the Neighbouring <hi>Iſles</hi>) by <hi>Roger Burges,</hi> the Governour; which at length, all being loſt, he likewiſe quitted, ſtipulating ſome Months Pay for his Garriſon, and Permiſſion to depart.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Col. Haynes,</hi> a Principal <hi>Tribune</hi> amongſt the Rebels, with Two Regiments of Foot, and Four Troops of Horſe, having ſlain ..... a brave Man, at his landing, the reſt upon the fall of their Leader running away, left him the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Jerſey.</hi> There were Two Caſtles in it, almoſt impregnable, but, that nothing is ſo, where fear is predominant. <hi>Mont Orgueil</hi> made no Reſiſtance.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:97792:131"/>And, <hi>Castle Elizabeth,</hi> ſurrounded with Rocks and the Ocean, and conſequently inacceſſible, tho it held out ſome conſiderable Time, followed the Fate of the Iſland; Sir <hi>George Cartaret,</hi> the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> having obtained Conditions for himſelf to paſs into <hi>France,</hi> and Impunity for the Iſlanders that returned to their Houſes.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> hitherto kept by the Noble <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Derby,</hi> who had ſo bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Lathome Houſe</hi> againſt the Inſults of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> cloſed this Fatal Roll; by ſo much the more illuſtrious, as being the laſt, who fell in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of her King and Country.</p>
                        <p>After ſo many Victorious and uninterrupted Succeſſes, the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> grew eminently high, enjoying Peace, and the quiet Fruition of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Tyranny. The <hi>Regicides</hi> were not only fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Home, but formidable to their Neighbours. And yet, one thing ſeemed ſtill neceſſary to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their Government, which was, to reconcile the King's Party to them. But, this being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult, but impoſſible, with ſuch who prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Loyalty and Honour before all things, and particularly, ſo ſordid a Compliance; the Enemy, upon conſideration of it, had ſeveral bloody Conſults about their Extirpation and Maſſacre. The buſineſs was long debated in a <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War;</hi> and, carried in the Negative, as too Cruel, but by Two Voices. And now, what they cannot effect by Severity, they will endeavour to compaſs by fair Means. An <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,</hi> or Act of Oblivion, tho with many intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Exceptions, is publiſhed, which gave hopes to ſuch who lived quietly and peaceably, of being in time admitted to Publick Employments in the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> Nor was it abſurd in them, to pretend to a continuance of their Uſurpation, by allaying the Heats and Hate of all Parties. But,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:97792:132"/>this precaution proved fruitleſs; for, an unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Adverſary of their own hatching, ſtarting up amongſt themſelves, did as ſuddenly ſuppreſs them.</p>
                        <p>In the mean Time, the <hi>New Common-wealth,</hi> as they were great at Home, ſo they were formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Abroad; being acknowledged by all, courted by ſome, and looked upon as very conſiderable, by ſuch who affected them leaſt; The <hi>Spaniard, French, Portugal, Suedes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> and others, ſaluted this Riſing <hi>State</hi> with Embaſſies; being alſo reſaluted in form, eſpecially by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by reaſon of their Parallel Beginnings, and manner of Government. St. <hi>Johns</hi> and <hi>Strickland</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with great Pomp, not only <hi>to offer them Peace, but to invite them to a Coalition or Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of the Two Nations in One.</hi> But, theſe <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi> not having been received with ſuch Warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as they expected by the <hi>States,</hi> but alſo uſed with all manner of Indignities by the <hi>Royolliſts,</hi> and ſuch who favoured the King, they returned home without effecting what they came for, fraught with rage and ſcorn againſt their Rival-Siſter; Which afterwards broke out into a moſt cruel and laſting War, as we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cromwel,</hi> after the Victory at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> as if endued with another Spirit, ſeemed to arrogate the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> to himſelf, which appeared by his offering to knight <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood</hi> in the Field of Battle; which he had alſo done, if he had not been diſſwaded by ſome of his Confidents. The War being now ended, and he at leiſure, he reaſſumed his Thoughts, which he had always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, of his future Greatneſs. He had, for as much as in him lay, rendered the <hi>Parliament</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the People, as the Authors of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Time of Peace, and the only Authors of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:97792:132"/>all their Grievances: And, as he had incited the <hi>Agitators</hi> to Murther the King, he now again ſtirs them up with the Charms of Promiſes, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute this <hi>hated Juncto.</hi> They therefore, <hi>accuſe the Members of it, with Covetouſneſs, Tyranny, and a Deſign of perpetuating themſelves in their Empire.</hi> They tell, <hi>how they had arrogated to themſelves, their Friends and Dependants, all the Honours, Commands, and Lucrative Employments of the Kingdom.</hi> They therefore, whoſe Arms were not Mercenary, but taken up in Defence of their Common Liberty, and who would not lay them down till they had obtained the ends they ſtrove for, <hi>did</hi> (how ever threatned) <hi>require, That the Parliament ſhould at length put a Period to their Seſſion, and let another more equal Repreſentative be choſen in their Place.</hi> The Commanders hoped perhaps to be elected in their Rooms. And, ſome undoubtedly had a regard to <hi>Liberty,</hi> that the People might not ſtill be ſubjected to the ſame Maſters. The <hi>Senators</hi> were not a little perplexed with theſe Novelties; the Army eſpecially mutinying to that Height, that ſome of the Common Souldiers, did impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently dare to draw their Swords upon their Lords with Threats and Inſultings. Nay, the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> ſometimes their beſt Friends, who had ſo often promiſed and proteſted to live and dye with them, actuated with the ſame Spirit of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do now queſtion their Integrity, blame their Conduct, and diſown their Proceedings.</p>
                        <p>Things being at this paſs, <hi>Cromwel</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened the Chief Officers of the Army, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>pretended Members</hi> of the <hi>Juncto,</hi> in the <hi>Speaker</hi>'s Houſe, declaimed highly againſt the preſent State of Affairs; demonſtrating, that there was no Good to be hoped or expected from a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> ſo conſtituted, as being corrupt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to perpetuate it ſelf. He added ſomewhat
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:97792:133"/>of a mixt and well tempered <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which how ever magnified by the <hi>Lawyers</hi> who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as moſt conſonant to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of the Nation, was highly oppoſed by the Officers, who were more than Monarchs in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Governments. Some had propoſed, to elect the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the King's Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Brother, as leaſt obnoxious to the Wiles of the Enemy, by reaſon of his tender Years; but, this alſo diſpleaſed, and nothing was fixed upon. In the mean time, ſeveral Petitions out of the Counties, were preſented to <hi>Cromwell;</hi> in which, after an Enumeration of his Glorious Actions, they earneſtly deſire, <hi>That God having given him the Power of the Sword, they might be eaſed of their Grievances, by his and his Armies mediation.</hi> Moved with theſe Supplications, and his own Ambition, he ceaſed not to preſs the <hi>Members</hi> ſingly and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, to put an End to their odious Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and permit the Election of a new Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of Men, ſingular for their Integrity and Holineſs of Life, to whom the Government might be transferred. But, theſe <hi>Conſcript Fathers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht with the Sweets of Empire, turned every Stone to prevent their caſheering; and, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently urged to it, promiſed that they would name a day for the ending of this Seſſion. But, <hi>Cromwell</hi> raving with the Thoughts of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and looking upon every Delay as pernicious, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> having taxed all with their Crimes, pointing at ſeveral with his Finger, accuſed ſome of <hi>Adultery,</hi> ſome of <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,</hi> others of <hi>Gluttony,</hi> and not a few of <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing</hi> the <hi>Common wealth;</hi> And, his Officers, upon his ſtamping with his Foot, which was the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, crowding in to him, he turned out this Hated <hi>Juncto;</hi> putting a Period to that deteſtable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which had thus long abuſed the Sacred Name of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:97792:133"/>
                        <p>And, here we ought to adore the <hi>unſearchable Judgments</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſeeing them, who violated the Majeſty of their own <hi>Lord,</hi> become Slaves, by as juſt Retribution, to their own Servants. 'Tis ſcarce credible, with what univerſal Applauſe this Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was effected: not, that better Times (unleſs the King were reſtored) durſt be hoped for; but, that People were willing to try every Change, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than longer to bear the Yoke of this odious Domination. And, thus this perfidious Servant, ſubverted his equally perfidious Superiors; and conſtituting a <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> which ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern at his beck, requires by Proclamation, the Subjects Obedience and Submiſſion, under great Penalties, to their Dictates.</p>
                        <p>Many eminent Men, have acquired Dominion over their Fellows by Fortitude and Vertue; and, ſome by flagitious and deteſtable Crimes; but, very few by cheating; and perhaps, ſcarce another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who ever invaded, and obtained the <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> by Tears, and Sighs, and Lyes, and Pretences of Religion. And yet, it was with theſe Arts, that this <hi>Ambitious Trooper,</hi> and <hi>Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> having deceived the Army he commanded, being <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and gained the <hi>Independants</hi> by Benefits, durſt attempt what ever Power and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition could ſuggeſt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Mock-Parliament</hi> being turned out, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Employments in the Kingdom, were by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation confirmed in their Hands that enjoyed them: whilſt the Souldiery by Sea and Land, as alſo the Armies in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> did not only approve of this Change by their ſuffrages, but by their congratulatory Addreſſes too, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting their Obedience to their <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> and his Orders in all Things. But <hi>Cromwell,</hi> leſt he might ſeem to arrogate the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thereby offend the Diſſenting Brethren;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:97792:134"/>and, the better to delude the <hi>Democraticks</hi> with the jugglings of Appearances, convened another Aſſembly by advice of his Officers, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one Hundred and Four and Twenty.

                        <p>The People of <hi>England,</hi> had about Two Years paſt commenc'd a War againſt the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces;</hi> which was, by ſo much the more fierce, as being betwixt Two Rival <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> both equally jealous of each others Greatneſs; beſides, that both did endeavour to render themſelves Maſters of the Traffick of the Ocean. The Cauſes divulged in <hi>Manifeſto's</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> on both ſides, were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> inſiſting chiefly upon <hi>Doriſlaus</hi> his Murther, and the unrevenged Contumelies thrown upon their Embaſſadors St. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at the <hi>Hague.</hi> The firſt Blow was, a Civil <hi>Edict,</hi> prohibiting all Men of what Nation ſoever, <hi>to bring any Commodities or Merchandize into</hi> England, <hi>but ſuch as was of the Growth of the Country from whence they brought them.</hi> This, as it was very
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97792:135"/>advantagious to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo it was ruinous to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whom it alſo chiefly aimed at, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in Shipping, and producing nothing of their own Growth but Butter and Cheeſe; who, however potent at Sea (the <hi>Scots</hi> being now van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed) ſent Four Embaſſadors into <hi>England</hi> to endeavour to mitigate the Rigor of this Act, and conclude the Treaty which had been begun at the <hi>Hague;</hi> but, to little purpoſe: For, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being heightened with ſo many Victories, propoſe new Conditions to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> arrogating to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, reaſonably enough, the <hi>Herring</hi>-Fiſhing, and the Honour of the <hi>Flag.</hi> They alſo, revive the Slaughtering of their Country-men at <hi>Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and pretend a free Paſſage for Navigation thro the <hi>Scheld</hi> to <hi>Antwerp.</hi> The Embaſſadors diſdaining the Pride and Haughtineſs of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> bragged alſo with no leſs Arrogance of their Hundred and Fifty <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> which they had in Readineſs. Whilſt they were thus cavilling, they were both ſurprized with the Rumor of an Engagement betwixt <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Tromp,</hi> their Two Admirals. The manner thus; <hi>Tromp</hi> with a Fleet of Forty Ships of War, met <hi>Blake</hi> with only Fifteen, to whom <hi>Bourn</hi> came with Eight more out of the <hi>Downs,</hi> tho not till after they were engaged. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to vindicate the Honour of the <hi>Flag,</hi> warned the adverſe Admiral by a Shot to ſtrike, which was repeated Thrice: But <hi>Tromp</hi> confident in his Numbers and Strength, anſwered him at firſt with Contempt, by diſcharging a Gun on the contrary ſide; and then putting out the <hi>Bloody Flag,</hi> gave him his whole Tyre of Ordnance. <hi>Blake</hi> replyed in kind, which engaged both Fleets, both fighting with great Valour until the Night parted them. The <hi>Dutch</hi> loſt Two of their Ships, one being taken, as alſo the Captains of both; whilſt the other abandoned by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97792:136"/>left to the Mercy of the Waves. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were much endamaged in their Rigging and Sails, their Loſs in Men being but inconſiderable; not above Forty ſlain and wounded.</p>
                        <p>The Embaſſadors being informed of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Fight, and finding they had got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it, ſeemed to deprecate the Offence, as an accidental Encounter, and in no wiſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Knowledge, or by any Command of the <hi>States General.</hi> But their Excuſes were not received; ſo that they broke out into an open War on both ſides, which was carried on with equal Violence and Emulation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Blake</hi> ſailing Northward, fell in with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Herring-Fleet, which he diſperſed in a Moment, taking all their Convoy, which conſiſted of Twelve Men of War. <hi>Tromp</hi> came ſhortly after into that Sea, with Deſign to meet their <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Merchant Ships; which having ſent Home, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to adventure another Battle with <hi>Blake.</hi> But, being diverted by a violent Storm, he could not recover his own Coaſts without Difficulty. Several Encounters happened bewixt theſe potent Parties upon other Occaſions, with various Succeſſes. Sir <hi>George Ayſcue</hi> defeated a Fleet of Merchants in the Channel, taking and ſinking ſeveral of them. And, ſome time after, meeting another Crew of them, convoyed by Sixty Men of <hi>War,</hi> fought them. The Combat laſted from Four in the Afternoon, till the Night ſeparated them, with equal Valour and Loſs. The <hi>Dutch</hi> continued their Way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> retreating to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to repair the Dammage received in the Fight, which ſeemed to imply the Advantage of the Enemy. In the mean Time, ſeveral Trading-Ships, as well of the <hi>French</hi> as <hi>Dutch,</hi> were daily made Prize of. And, <hi>Blake</hi> took the whole <hi>French Fleet,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Relief of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> whereof he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97792:136"/>brought Seven to <hi>Dover;</hi> which obliged the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirkers,</hi> to ſurrender their Town into the Hands of the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> who beſieged them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>States,</hi> for the better Government of their Fleets, had appointed ſome of their Members to embark with them, as well to adviſe with their Councils as to ſuperviſe the Actions of their Chiefs. And now <hi>De Wit</hi> is at Sea with Sixty Ships of Force; but, he did not think fit, to wait <hi>Blake</hi>'s ſailing towards him out of the <hi>Downs;</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, did dare to diſturb his Rear with his nimbleſt Sailors. But, <hi>Tromp</hi> having got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a great Fleet, conſiſting of Fourſcore brave appointed Ships, reſolved to attempt <hi>Blake</hi> in the very <hi>Downs;</hi> who, however not exceeding half the other in Numbers, ſtay'd for him. The Fight was great, and the Victory bravely conteſted for, until the Night parted them. But, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overpowered, having loſt Two Ships, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated with the reſt to <hi>Dover,</hi> and thence into the River of <hi>Thames.</hi> Nor was the Victory blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on the Enemies ſide, having many of their Ships torn and diſabled. <hi>Tromp</hi> fierce with his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, wandered now at pleaſure uncontrouled, and vainly bearing a Beeſom at his Main Top, bragg'd he would ſweep the Sea of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> having prepared a very great Fleet of Eighty Ships of War, conſtituted a <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate</hi> of <hi>Admirals, Blake</hi> being ſtill one, <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Monk</hi> the other. Theſe being ready ſooner than the <hi>Dutch</hi> expected, attended <hi>Tromp</hi> with a great Fleet of Merchants, returning from the Ports of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Nor had they waited long, when they diſcovered this numerous Enemy be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> betwixt them and <hi>Portland. Blake</hi> ſails direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards them. And <hi>Tromp</hi> no leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, prepares to receive him. The Fight was cruel and bloody, the Succeſs alſo being various in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97792:137"/>the divers Parts of it, until the Night parted them. On the Morrow, they engage again. <hi>Tromp</hi> having ſent his loaden Veſſels before, cloſed their Rear with his Ships of War, and fights retreating. The Third day the Battle being renewed, the <hi>Dutch</hi> after a ſtout Conflict, got away by Favour of the Darkneſs, having loſt Eleven of their Men of War, and Thirty of the Merchant Ships. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt the <hi>Sampſon</hi> (but ſaved her Men) as alſo the Captains, <hi>Mildmay</hi> and <hi>Ball,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Triumph</hi> and <hi>Vanguard;</hi> and, <hi>Blake</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was wounded in his Thigh. The ſlaughter on both ſides, eſpecially the Enemies, was very great. <hi>Tromp</hi> gained great Honour, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, for ſaving his Fleet; juſtly attributing the Cauſe of his Retreat, to his Care for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, which he convoy'd.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> admoniſhed by their Loſſes, write to the <hi>Rump</hi> for a Reconciliation; but, ſeeing the other Provinces had not concurred, their Letters were rejected. But, what the <hi>Dutch</hi> loſt in the <hi>Channel,</hi> ſeemed to be compenſated by their Victory in the <hi>Tyrrehenian</hi> Sea off of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> where <hi>Van Galen</hi> defeated <hi>Appelton,</hi> taking and ſinking Fire <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>War.</hi> He had formerly taken the <hi>Phenix</hi> at <hi>Porta Longona,</hi> which was afterwards recovered by <hi>Cox,</hi> ſometime her Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; who in the Night, under the Notion of Fiſher-men, clapt her on Board with a Hundred Men in Three Boats, forcing Young <hi>Tromp</hi> who commanded her, to ſave himſelf out of the Cabin Window, and brought her to <hi>Naples.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> favouring the <hi>Dutch,</hi> had detained an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet in the <hi>Sound,</hi> loaden with Maſts, Pitch, Tar, Hemp and other Naval Proviſions, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mainly wanted.

But, though the Army were great, the Proviſions made for it were not ſo; the <hi>Generals</hi> perhaps thinking, that they did but need, to <hi>Come</hi> and <hi>Conquer.</hi> With theſe Forces and vaſt expectations, they ſailed towards <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come within the Sight of <hi>San Domingo,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> terrified with the Danger, abandoned their City, and fled into Woods, leaving all to the Diſcretion of the Aſſailants. But, the

                           <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the vain Precaution of their Governours, fearing I know not what imaginary Ambuſcades, omitted and loſt the Opportunity; for, leaving the Port, <hi>Venables</hi> landed Ten Leagues from the Town with Seven Thouſand Men. The Souldiers were brisk and fierce, promiſing themſelves Gold and Wealth, even to Satiety. But, their Joy did not laſt long; for, it was proclaimed under pain of Death, that none ſhould plunder Gold, Silver, Jewels, or any other precious Moveables, or kill any tame Cattle. The Souldiers damp'd with this unſeaſonable Order, deſtitute now of the Solace of Hope it ſelf, moved but dully; and, marching through thick Woods, ſcorching Sands, exceſſive Heat of the Sun, and its concomitant, unſufferable Thirſt, they at length came to the aſſigned <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous. Collonel Buller</hi> met them there, with Three Regiments from the Fleet, where they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refreſhed; for, there was a River of Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, which diſcharges it ſelf into the Sea. The Forces being joyned, <hi>Venables</hi> marches with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my towards the City, having ſent <hi>Captain Cox,</hi> who was alſo their Guide, with Five Hundred Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a <hi>Forlorn.</hi> And, they proved ſo. In the mean Time, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> taking Courage from their Enemies loitering, and perceiving the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties they laboured under, betake themſelves to their Defence; and, falling briskly upon them in the Intricacies of their Paſſage with a handful of Men, they kill <hi>Cox,</hi> and rout his Party, who ruſhing upon the next Regiment put it to Flight. Upon advance of the Army, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> retired into a Fort they had in the Wood. <hi>Venables,</hi> after this bruſh, return'd back to the River, with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to re-aſſume his Deſign: And, having mounted Two Guns, provided Scaling-ladders, Mortars, Granado's and Fire-balls, he marches the ſecond Time towards the City. But, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:97792:140"/>by the Errors of his <hi>Guides,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to lead him a more commodious Way for the avoiding of the Fort, he is brought into the ſame place where they had already fought ſo unluckily. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but Seventy in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſallying haſtily out of their Ambuſhes, fell with ſuch Violence upon the Van Guard, that the <hi>Forlorn</hi> being beaten into the next following <hi>Battalion,</hi> that alſo turned upon their own Army, and filling all with Terror, they all ran away. The Enemy purſued with a great ſlaughter; nor did they retire, till they were wearied with killing, and carried away Seven Colours in ſign of Victory. <hi>Collonel Haynes</hi> having with great Courage endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make Head againſt them, being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, was ſlain by them, and with him Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more, beſides ſeveral wounded. Theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, were followed by the Negligence of the Commanders, with want of Proviſions; ſo, that ſeveral of the Souldiers ſtraying in the Woods in Queſt of Victuals, were ſnapt up by the Enemy. Their Wants growing daily upon them, they eat all their Horſes, which they had brought in a fine Troop with them from the <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> and, theſe not ſufficing, they at length reſolved to leave this unlucky Shore: Which they did, ſailing with their baffled Army to <hi>Jamaica;</hi> where, the News of their Defeat not being yet arrived, they eaſily landed, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there articling for Liberty to depart, which they eaſily conſented to. This Iſland is very pleaſant, Sixty Leagues in Length, and Thirty in Breadth. But, they met here with an Enemy more ſevere than the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> which was the Plague; which, in a little Time, reduced their Army to ſewer than Two Thouſand. Thoſe who ſurvived, being recruited with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Men from <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Iſland</hi> being alſo cleared of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is now become a famous <hi>Colony</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

                        <p>But, <hi>Admiral Blake</hi>'s Succeſſes were greater, tho' they did not make more Noiſe in the World. The <hi>Algerines,</hi> upon Sight of the Fleet ſo far ſuperior to theirs, making a Peace with him, conſented to the Reſtitution of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Slaves, and a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Commerce. But, they of <hi>Tunis,</hi> truſting to their own Strength, anſwered <hi>Blake</hi>'s Summons fiercely; ſhewing him, by way of oſtentation, their Caſtles in the <hi>Guletta,</hi> and their Fleet in that impregnable Receptacle of <hi>Porta-ferino. Blake</hi> reſolving always on the brave, filling his long Boats with his boldeſt Adventurers, ſent them into the Haven to burn their Ships. Which they alſo effected, conſuming Nine of them with Fire, with the inconſiderable Loſs of Five and Twenty Men. All this while, the Ships of the Fleet thundred terribly with their Cannon upon their Caſtles and Batteries, diſmounting for the moſt part their Guns, and forcing the Defendants to abandon their Works. The <hi>Infidels</hi> thus chaſtiſed, became more ſubmiſs, being glad to accept of that Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, they had lately ſo inſolently refuſed.</p>

                           <hi>Cromwell</hi> being ſecure Abroad, had at Home de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated all the Endeavours of the <hi>Royalliſts,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Democraticks,</hi> for the recovering of their Liberty. All theſe Attempts were ſtifled in their Infancy, or betrayed in their Growth, before they came to any Ripeneſs; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting nothing, but the Ruine of ſuch who were concerned in them, and the ſecuring of him in his Tyranny, whoſe Deſtruction was ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately deſired. This cruel <hi>Protector,</hi> had affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> with all manner of Torments in their Perſons. And now, having conſtituted <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Generals,</hi> after the Manner of the <hi>Turkiſh Baſhaws,</hi> in all the Kingdom; decimated, and confiſcated their Goods; and raging againſt their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with Incarcerations, Baniſhments, and Death it
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:97792:141"/>ſelf, expoſed them to all the Miſeries their inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Malice could invent. But, ſeeing that all would not do, and that they were Proof againſt the utmoſt ſeverity; he changed his Battery, and will now try to gain them by Civilities, and a more gentle Uſage. But, that taking no effect with Men immoveable in their Loyalty, and whom nothing could oblige to abandon that Cauſe, they had ſo religiouſly maintained; he thought of other ways to be rid of theſe Men, ſo averſe to his Tyranny. Upon this accompt, he permits Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Miniſters in League with him, to make Levies of them for their Wars, the Priſons having often times been emptied for that purpoſe. The <hi>Colonies,</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> conſumed many of them by Slavery, and others allured into the unfortunate expedition of <hi>San Domingo,</hi> periſhed in it. His Domeſtick Enemies being thus removed or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> became alſo formidable to Strangers. And, now it ſeemed ſeaſonable for him to think of transmitting his Tyranny to his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. As he had uſurp'd the Power of a King, ſo he ambition'd the Title, which a <hi>Parliament</hi> he had convened for his Purpoſe, endeavoured to inveſt him with. But, he was oppoſed by the Chiefs of the Army, who expected, and hoped after his Fate, to have their Turns in the <hi>Supremacy.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he managed his Deſign ſo well, that he was created <hi>Sovereign Protector,</hi> with Power to name his Succeſſor; which was, in effect, what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, in rendring his Tyranny Hereditary.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to repay one War with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeized and confiſcated all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Goods and Shipping in his Dominions, and by a Publick Edict, declared War againſt the Nation. But, <hi>Cromwell</hi> acting more Effectually, ſent <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Montague</hi> with a Fleet to ſhut up the Haven of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where the Rich Ships from
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:97792:141"/>the <hi>Indies</hi> uſually arrived. <hi>Stayner,</hi> with his Squadron of Seven Frigats,<note place="margin">1656.

This was a great Victory, wherein they took above Two Millions of <hi>Pieces of Eight.</hi> But, that which <hi>Blake</hi> won at <hi>Teneriffe</hi> the Year following, ſurpaſſed all other in Nobleneſs of Action, and Reſolution of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers.

Apr. 20.</note> having Intelligence that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were cruiſing upon the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, put into the Haven of <hi>Santa Cruz;</hi> where, by the Advantage of their ſtrong Caſtle at the Entry, and Seven Forts round the Bay, they thought themſelves ſecure. But, <hi>Blake</hi> perceiving their Order, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Stayner,</hi> a brave Commander, with ſome nimble Frigats before, followed himſelf with the reſt of his Fleet. And, plying the Caſtle and Forts, with his great Ships, beat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from their Guns; and, after a ſharp Fight, took the Fleet, abandoned by the Sea-men who ran on Shore; but, not being able to carry it away with them, they ſet in on fire, conſuming both it and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Riches it was fraughted with. A <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving-Day</hi> being appointed in <hi>England</hi> for this ſo eminent a Victory, <hi>Blake</hi> was honoured by the <hi>Parliament</hi> with a Preſent of Five Hundred Pounds.

                        <p>Nor was it at Sea only that <hi>Cromwell</hi> plagued the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> for, he ſent Six Thouſand Men, under the Command of <hi>Collonel Reynolds</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> who much facilitated the Succeſſes of the <hi>French.

                           <hi>OLiver</hi> having during his Sickneſs been vainly confident of his Recovery, which he alſo had been deluded into an Aſſurance of, by his Chaplains and Flatterers; had neglected the Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of a Succeſſor, as he was authorized to do by the <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Advice.</hi> 'Twas thought, he ballanced in his Choice betwixt his Son and Son-in-law <hi>Fleetwood;</hi> which his <hi>Council</hi> finding, and perceiving his Spirits and Senſes to fail, demanded of him, If he did not appoint his Son <hi>Richard</hi> to Succeed him? To which he anſwering, as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in the Affirmative; <hi>Richard,</hi> as ſoon as he expired, was ſaluted and proclaimed <hi>Protector</hi> in his Fathers Room. But very unlike him in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and the Arts of Government; as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by his being diſturbed from the quiet Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:97792:143"/>of Three Kingdoms, by thoſe he neither had Wit nor Courage to ſuppreſs or oppoſe. He was in the mean time, as well as his Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and ſaluted, by the Army, the City, the Provinces and Foreign Miniſters and Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors. The Beginning of his Reign was ſerene, and his firſt Care, the Funeral of his Father. Which was performed with a more than Royal Magnificence, there having been Sixty Thouſand Pounds expended in it; this Treaſure, as it had been extorted by Tyranny, being conſumed in Luxury. His Corps, however wrapt up in a Sixfold Cerecloth, a Lead, and a Wooden Coffin, fermenting in this reſtraint, burſt out of it; and, filling all with a moſt noiſom Odour, was private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depoſited in <hi>Henry</hi> Vll<hi>'s</hi> Chappel, amongſt the Aſhes of King's; but, by the juſt Judgment of <hi>God,</hi> to be transferred and buried under the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as we have ſince ſeen.</p>
                        <p>The Officers of the Army, after all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to <hi>Richard,</hi> grew weary of him, as ſoon as they had well owned him; and, unmindful now of their Duty and Promiſes to him, by the Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of <hi>Lambert,</hi> formerly caſhier'd by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Concurrence of the <hi>Democraticks,</hi> having alſo drawn <hi>Fleetwood</hi> his Brother-in-law, and <hi>Deſbourough</hi> who had married his Aunt, into the Cabal, conſult how to aboliſh the <hi>Protectorate,</hi> and reſtore themſelves to their former Freedom. Nor was <hi>Richard</hi> ignorant of their Deſigns, but wanted Reſolution to ſuppreſs them; and, indeed, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to countenance the Undertakings of others, who offered their Service for the ſcizure or killing of theſe Mutineers. He had called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> by whoſe Authority, he ſuppoſed theſe Heats might be allayed; and, they endeavoured it. But, this Puny Prince, affrighted with the Threats and Noiſes of the adverſe Party, was perſwaded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97792:144"/>that <hi>Convention,</hi> however addicted to him. Hereupon, he is likewiſe laid aſide. The <hi>Rump,</hi> compoſed of thoſe <hi>Antimonarchiſts</hi> which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had formerly ejected, being introduced and ſeated in the Government again. His Brother <hi>Henry, Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> quitted alſo that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Army there, by command of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored Senate, with the like Puſillanimity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears, how ſordidly theſe Fellows degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their Father in Audaciouſneſs, though they reſembled him well enough in Wickedneſs. <hi>Monk,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Scotland,</hi> did likewiſe ſubmit; but, kept his Employment, thinking he had done enough, in congratulating their Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by Addreſſes and Meſſages.</p>
                        <p>The odious <hi>Oligarchy</hi> being reſtored, under the Title of a <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> and, acknowledged by the Army, and their Partiſans in the Provinces, drive more furiouſly than before, endeavouring to remove all Obſtacles and Impediments to their deſigned Tyranny. In order to this, they exact a ſpontaneous Abdication of the <hi>Protectorate,</hi> from <hi>Richard;</hi> which he tamely granted, promiſing further, <hi>To behave himſelf peaceably under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, from which he expected Protection.</hi> And thus this Muſhrom-Prince, the untimely Birth of a ſhort Relgn, turned out of <hi>White Hall,</hi> vaniſhed; and, will be no more heard of, but with Obloquy and Infamy. And yet, if he had had either Honour or Honeſty in him, he might have had one Game more to play, no leſs probable, than glorious, which was, the reſtoring of the King; ſeveral Overtures having been made to him, by the Royal Party, to that Purpoſe. The which, with his Intereſt in the Army, and <hi>Two Houſes,</hi> before their Diſſolution, might have been effected without a Miracle.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> was no ſooner ſeated, but they began to divide the Inheritance amongſt themſelves; and, whatever the <hi>Cromwellian</hi> ſtorm of Hail had left, theſe rapacious Locuſts did conſume and devour. But, the Univerſality of the Nation, trembled at theſe Preludes of Tyranny and Slavery; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved to ſuffer any thing, rather than the known Domination of the <hi>Regicides,</hi> took up Arms in divers Counties. Nor were the <hi>Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaes</hi> ignorant of theſe Deſigns. They therefore to prevent them, fill the Priſons with the moſt ſuſpected, and command all thoſe who had ſerved the King, to leave the City, and not to return without Permiſſion. The ſwift Motion of their Horſe, hindred the Riſings in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> and ſome other Counties. And yet, they got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> under the Command of Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> to a conſiderable Body, being aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton, Randal Egerton Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General,</hi> and <hi>Colonel Worden,</hi> with others, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and a <hi>Free Parliament.</hi> Having poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Cheſter, Mancheſter,</hi> and <hi>Warrington,</hi> they became formidable.

Which he alſo did, with no great Difficulty; their raw unexperienced <hi>Militia,</hi> not being able to ſtand the ſhock of an Army, fluſht with ſo many Succeſſes. So that, attacking them at <hi>Norwich</hi>-Bridge, where <hi>Morgan,</hi> a brave Youth, was ſlain, they forced it, routing and defeating the whole Party. <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and the other Fortreſſes, were all retaken; and <hi>Booth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being fled, was afterwards diſcovered in Womans Cloths at <hi>Newport,</hi> and was caſt into the <hi>Tower.</hi>

                        <p>The Men at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſwoln with this Victory, having thereby reduced the Kingdom to their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, reſolve to call the Authors of this Late War, to a very ſevere Accompt, thirſting no leſs after their Eſtates and Poſſeſſions, than their Blood. In the mean time, <hi>Montague,</hi> who had been ſent in <hi>Richard</hi>'s Protectorate into <hi>Denmark,</hi> with a great Fleet, invited by the King unto whom he was reconciled, and commanded by him, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>England</hi> with his Naval Power, to help to free his Native Country from Oppreſſion and Slavery. But, hearing by the Way, of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of the <hi>Royalliſts,</hi> the Secret was not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, tho he returned with the Fleet; and was commanded by the <hi>Rump,</hi> who ſuſpected his Faith, to his Houſe, till they ſhould be at leiſure to take an Accompt of his Voyage, and Actions.</p>
                        <p>The Enemy being ſubdued, theſe Blood-Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals judging of the Juſtice of their Cauſe by the Succeſs, and thinking nothing bad, but what was improſperous, looked upon themſelves as owned by Heaven. But yet, their joy was but ſhort-liv'd; for, whilſt they go on ſecurely, they were yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the Juſt Judgment of <hi>God,</hi> diſturbed by their own Servants. <hi>Lambert</hi> after his Victory aiming at greater Things, began not only to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his Equals, but to deſpiſe his Superiors alſo. But, the Army was firſt to be gained, which he endeavoured to do, by the uſual Charms of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; attributing to them, the Glories of their Atchievements, and the Honour of the late Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He alſo diſtributed amongſt them, the Thouſand Pounds, which theſe nefarious <hi>Senators</hi> had beſtowed on him: affirming, that Preſents of that kind, were no leſs due to them by whoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude Great Actions were performed, than to him by whoſe Conduct they were effected. With theſe Arts, he rendered the Souldiers not only
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97792:145"/>favourable, but ſubſervient to his Deſigns. Whilſt he is thus employed, he received Letters from the <hi>Senate</hi> (who began to ſuſpect him of ambitious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues) but very obligingly writ, to invite him to Town; which he inſtantly obeyed, being ſecure in the Souldiers affection, and that he might give no Shadow of Diſtruſt by his Delay. A Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from the reſt of the Commanders to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> followed the <hi>General,</hi> wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, That <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> ſhould have the Chief Command and Generalſhip of the Army. The <hi>Parliament</hi> who had conferred that Province upon their <hi>Speaker,</hi> who had alſo hitherto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned theſe very Officers, ſtartled at ſo unuſual a Demand, and fancying if they yielded they were undone, Vote, <hi>That to have any more General-Officers in the Army, than are already ſettled by the Parliament, was unneceſſary, burthenſom and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the</hi> Common-wealth. But, the Souldiers perſiſting in their arrogant Demands, this Vote was followed by another, declaring, <hi>That it ſhould be Treaſon for any Perſon or Perſons, to levy Money without the conſent of</hi> Parliament. By this means, theſe States thought, and reaſonably enough, to render the Souldiers for the future, more obedient to them from whom they were to expect their Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and Rewards. This done, they (animated perhaps more with Choler than Counſel) caſheer <hi>Lambert,</hi> as Chief of the Conſpiracy, and Eight more of the boldeſt Tribunes of his Party; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Chief Command of the Army, upon Seven of their own Tribe, <hi>viz. Fleetwood, Monk, Hazelrig, Ludlow, Walton, Morley</hi> and <hi>Overton.</hi> But, the disbanded Officers diſdaining to be thus uſed, armed with Revenge and Ambition, flew with their Regiments to <hi>Weſtminiſter,</hi> filling the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Court with their Souldiers, reſolving to hinder the ſitting of the <hi>Members.</hi> The <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                           <pb n="284" facs="tcp:97792:146"/>on the other ſide, loth to diſlodge, ſolicited the reſt of the Army to their Aſſiſtance, and had them. Being drawn up on both ſides, they yet paſt no further than Threats, being pacified by the Care and Authority of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> But, <hi>Lambert</hi> gained his deſir'd end, in hindering the <hi>Speaker</hi> to go to the Houſe, and ſending him Home without his <hi>Pretorian</hi> Troop which had attended him thither, and more like a Captive, than a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or an <hi>Imperial Speaker.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Independant</hi> Faction being thus divided, the <hi>Civil</hi> Part of it was forced to truckle to the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;</hi> and now in Contempt of the Authority of their <hi>Senate, Fleetwood,</hi> no great Souldier but a valiant Holder-forth, by Suffrage of the Council of Officers, was made General, and <hi>Lambert</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General; to whoſe Artifice, the other was obnoxious. They alſo, erected a <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> conſiſting of Three and Twenty Commiſſioners, moſt Officers; to whom, the Supreme Care of the Laws and Government were at preſent committed, with Inſtructions, to introduce a new Form of a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> The State being thus ſettled, <hi>Lambert</hi> endeavours by a Declaration, to calm the Minds of Men, diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo many Novelties, with the Show and Aſſurance or their Liberties, both Sacred and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and ſending ſome of his<note n="*" place="margin">Colbet, Barrow.</note> Confidents into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> attempts all ways to draw thoſe Armies to his Party. But, without Succeſs; for, <hi>Ireland</hi> being addicted to the <hi>Rump,</hi> continued faithful to them. And <hi>Monk,</hi> did dare openly to diſſent from the new Modellers. Part alſo of the Fleet, under their Vice-Admiral <hi>Lawſon,</hi> did ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demand the Reſtitution of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and, <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> a ſtrong Sea Town, revolted from our Noveliſts.</p>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:97792:146"/>
                        <p>The <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Safety</hi> being in theſe Streights, provide with their utmoſt Care, Remedies for ſo many Evils. <hi>Lambert</hi> is ſent with a great Army, conſiſting of Twelve Thouſand Men, againſt <hi>Monk;</hi> and Forces were likewiſe ſent to reduce <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> the Fleet being invited by Meſſages and Promiſes, to return to their Obedience. But, theſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proved every where fruitleſs; for, the Fleet blocking up the Mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> perſiſted in their Obſtinacy. The <hi>Parlamentarians</hi> at <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> were grown formidable, by the Acceſſion of thoſe that beſieged them, who had revolted to them; and, <hi>Ireland</hi> following the Example of the other Diſſenters, declared for the <hi>Parliament.</hi> But, the greateſt Danger that threatned them, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>North;</hi> for, <hi>Monk</hi> in his Letters to <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> did dare to diſapprove the Actions of the Army, requiring the immediate Reſtitution of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And, muſtering his Army, having turn'd out ſuch of his Officers as favoured the contrary Party, he marched Southwards and ſeizes the ſtrong Town of <hi>Berwick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> ſtartled with <hi>Monk</hi>'s Proceedings, ſend Embaſſadors to him to treat of Peace and a mutual Correſpondence betwixt them, giving out at the ſame time Commiſſions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for new Levies; being reſolved, if the Treaty did not ſucceed, to vindicate their Power by Arms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lambert,</hi> as is ſaid, was marched towards the Confines of the Kingdom with his Army, the <hi>Committee</hi> omitting no Induſtry, whereby they might divert this growing ſtorm in the <hi>North. Monk</hi> alſo, revolving the Danger and Greatneſs of his Enterprize, will do nothing raſhly. He appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army as brave and numerous, and therefore reſolves, to protract and delay Time. His Friends alſo out of <hi>England,</hi> had aſſured him,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97792:147"/>that the New Government there was odious to the Nation, which would alſo, for want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Council, if he delay'd a little, fall by its own Weight. Moved with theſe Reaſons, and the Backwardneſs of his own Preparations, he ſeems leſs averſe to Peace than formerly; and, ſending Three Delegates to the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> magnifies his Deſires of an Accomodation. Theſe Embaſſadors, met <hi>Lambert</hi> at <hi>York;</hi> and, ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him abundantly of the peaceable Inclinations of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army, wrought ſo with him, that he prohibited the further Advance of his Forces.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Monk</hi> having thus lull'd his Adverſaries, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons a Convention of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility; from whom, not obſcurely informed or preſuming of his Intentions, he obtained Contributions for his Army for a Year before-hand, allowing them in return, Liberty to arm themſelves for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. In the mean time, a Pacification was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon at <hi>London,</hi> betwixt Commiſſioners of both ſides; where, amongſt other things, the Name and Family, and <hi>Royal</hi> Title of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> was wholly excluded; a Tyrannous <hi>Stratarchy,</hi> or Club-law being introduced under the Vail of a <hi>Free State. Monk</hi> having received the Articles agreed upon, recalls his Commiſſioners. And, caſting <hi>Wilks,</hi> the principal of them, into Priſon for exceeding his Orders, refuſes to ratify the Treaty; and, declaring the Pacification null, breaks out into Open War.</p>
                        <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> during theſe Traverſes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho they had diſapproved the Interruption of the <hi>Rump,</hi> did openly refuſe to joyn with the Army; daring, by Petitions and Tumults, to manifeſt their Deſires for a <hi>Free Parliament.</hi> And truly, ſuch were the Sentiments of the whole Nation, which enraged the Souldiery to that height, that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:97792:147"/>a great part of the Army was ſent into the City to keep them in their Obedience, denouncing Death and Ruine to the obſtinate. Nor did they thus attain the Ends of their Deſires, oppoſed by the contrary Strivings of the People, who would be ſatisfied with nothing, but the Reſtitution of This, or the Convocation of a New <hi>Parliament.</hi> Which they at length aſſented to, but with moſt ſervile Reſtrictions.</p>
                        <p>There was nothing of moment, happened this while upon the Borders. <hi>Monk</hi> was reſolved to delay and gain time; which he alſo did, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding Battle, and amuſing his Adverſaries with another Treaty at <hi>New-Caſtle.</hi> But, <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> head of the Chymerical <hi>Republick,</hi> unequal for ſo great a Weight, as ignorant of his own Strength; a Man neither conſtant to himſelf nor bravely perfidious, thinks of laying down his Burthen. Which he was the more inclined to, as believing, if <hi>Lambert</hi> returned with Victory, his Reign would be but very ſhort. To this, his Endeavours to reduce the Fleet had proved but vain, and that the Souldiers ſent againſt the Rebels at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> had revolted to them. To all this, he wanted Money for the Army he commanded, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being ready to Mutiny for want of Pay, and would infallibly rage with all the Extravagancies of Sedition and Tumult. Preſt with ſo many Evils, and dreading greater, this miſerable <hi>Holder-Forth,</hi> wretchedly ſubmits his Grandeur to the <hi>Rump,</hi> which he had ſo lately routed; and,<note place="margin">Dec. 26.</note> with ſordid Aſſentation, permits his old Maſters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Aſſembly as before.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> being thus reſtored, their firſt Buſineſs was, to remove <hi>Lambert,</hi> by whom they had been diſturbed, from his Command. Which was not difficult to effect; for, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brigades left him, and <hi>Desborough</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:97792:148"/>of <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s Souldiers, had abandoned him, which the reſt of his Army likewiſe did, upon receiving the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Pleaſure and Orders for that purpoſe. So that, this <hi>General</hi> who ſo lately hoped for Triumphs, by a ſtrange Viciſſitude of things, was forced to ſearch for a Retreat to hide himſelf, not unworthy the Fate that attended him, ſince he ſuffered himſelf to be deprived of ſo great an Army, without the Circumſtance of a Blow. Moreover, as moſt ample Conditions had been formerly preſented to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> upon returning to their Duty; ſo, no leſs Honours and Dignities, with the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had been offered by the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> in the King's Name to <hi>Lambert;</hi> and, not without Threats (which proved Prophecies) That if he refuſed this Opportunity, the King's Reſtitution would be worught, and that ſuddainly without him, and againſt his Will. He ſhould therefore make uſe of the Occaſion, to render himſelf and Poſterity great to after Ages. But, this Advice was in vain, he, as the reſt, being blinded with Ambition and the Frantick Deſire of Rule.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Monk</hi> being glad that the Enemy was diſperſed without a Blow, enters <hi>England</hi> with his little Army of Five Thouſand Men; tho the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> had aſſigned him but Five Hundred, ſending the reſt back with <hi>Morgan</hi> into <hi>Scotland.</hi> All the ſeveral <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> had an eye upon his Motions. The <hi>Rump</hi> preſumed by his Means, to tame the Contumacious City; and, the Citizens hoped that he would compel the <hi>Rump</hi> to admit of the <hi>Secluded Members</hi> again, or fill the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with new Elections. They had ſent their Sword-Bearer to Complement him upon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>England,</hi> and he was likewiſe congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by all the <hi>Provinces</hi> he paſt thro, as alſo by Deputations from the moſt remote Counties. The
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:97792:148"/>deſires of all good Men were, for a <hi>Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as the only remedy againſt the impending Evils, and, the true means to reduce the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> to its priſtine Forms of Government, and moſt holy Laws again. <hi>Monk,</hi> tho he was of the ſame Opinion, did not as yet think it convenient to diſcover himſelf ſo far. Leſt therefore, he might diſpleaſe thoſe, for whoſe ſake he had arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Returns to thoſe many Addreſſes to him were general and civil, intimating, that he would acquaint the <hi>Houſe</hi> with their Petitions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them; but, exhorts them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that they keep themſelves quiet and within the Bounds of Modeſty, permitting the Diſpoſal of Affairs to the Judgment and Prudence of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And, thus he moves forwards with ſlow Marches, forming the Garriſons and Forces in his Way to his own Humour. The <hi>Rump</hi> troubled that he was come with more Forces than they had deſigned, he pretending to ſecure them from all violence by them, ſolicitous of the many Petitions and Addreſſes to the <hi>General,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Hate of all Men towards themſelves, not knowing where to fix, ſend Two of their Members <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinſon,</hi> cunning Men to him, under pretence of congratulating his Arrival in <hi>England,</hi> but in effect to pry into his Actions, and to ſee what was to be expected from him. <hi>Monk</hi> received theſe Gentlemen with the greateſt. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance imaginable, very careful leaſt he might betray himſelf by any Inadvertency to theſe crafty Diſcoverers.</p>
                        <p>Being come to St. <hi>Albans,</hi> he was again ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Splendid Embaſſy from the City, which he received and diſmiſſed with great Civility co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Purpoſes, with a profound Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On the Second of <hi>February,</hi> he entered the City with his Army, and took his Lodging at
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:97792:149"/>
                           <hi>White-Hall,</hi> againſt the Opinion of all Men. The Third Day being attended upon by <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi> into the <hi>Houſe,</hi> he refuſed the Chair ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for him. But, leaning upon it, after he had received the <hi>Speaker</hi>'s Thanks and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his great Service in reſtoring the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by his Council and Arms, he replyed in theſe Terms. Firſt, <hi>having modestly declined ſo great praiſes; ſince he had done nothing but what his Duty obliged him to, He humbly offered to them, That they would be pleaſed to ſatisfy the People's Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by a Vindication of their Laws and Liberties, God having reſtored them, not ſo much to ſtudy their own as the Publick Welfare.</hi> He then deſired them, <hi>To remove the Jealouſies ſome Men conceived, of their Deſign of perpetuating themſelves in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and, that mindful of future</hi> Parliaments, <hi>they would fix a Period to this.</hi> Moreover, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them, <hi>Not to burthen the Subjects with New Oaths.</hi> And finally, <hi>That they ſhould take heed to the</hi> Royalliſts <hi>and</hi> Fanaticks; <hi>and commending</hi> Scotland, <hi>and a</hi> Free State <hi>to their Care,</hi> he finiſhed. There were they in the Aſſembly, who fancied, he ſpake more like a <hi>Dictator</hi> than an <hi>Orator,</hi> and yet he left them, loaden with Thanks and Congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to take his place appointed him in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> Here, he prudently declined the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Abjuration</hi> preſented to him; not as abſolutely refuſing it, but as deſiring time to conſider of it. For, the <hi>Rump</hi> compell'd all in Office, to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Right and Title of the King. By which means, they inſured them in their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and inſnared them in the ſame Bond of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> with themſelves.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Londoners</hi> deceived in their Expectations, began to Mutiny. They will acknowledge no Authority, but that of a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> and make a <hi>Decree</hi> in their <hi>Common Council,</hi> that for
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:97792:149"/>the future, they will pay no Taxes nor Impoſts whatever, to any but by order of ſuch a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, full and entirely their own Maſters. The <hi>Rump,</hi> mad with Anger, command <hi>Monk</hi> to march into the City with his Army, and order him to beat down the Gates and Portculliſes, break their Poſts and take away their Chains out of the Streets. Several alſo of the Prime Citizens, Aſſertors of Liberty, were put in the <hi>Tower,</hi> Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Fanaticks, being introduced into their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies. The People were amazed at theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Monk,</hi> from whom they had hoped better things. Whilſt he, revolving the Odiouſneſs of what he had done; however neceſſitated to it, by the preſſing Commands of the <hi>Juncto,</hi> and leſt he ſhould imprudently ſpoil what he had ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; and, not ignorant that theſe Tasks had been impoſed upon him, as well to try his Obedience as to break the Friendſhip and Intelligence which was betwixt him and the City, reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt greater Matters. To all this, he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Diminution of his Power with the Souldiers, which was likewiſe effected that very Day; the Command of the Army being given to a <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate</hi> of their own Confidents, he being but one of the Number. This highly diſpleaſed him; nor could he endure Co-Equals in Power, which the <hi>Rump</hi> forgetful that it was <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Caſe, had obtruded upon him. And, who indeed can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Sharers in that Power, he is ſolely Maſter of? <hi>Monk</hi> impatient of ſo ſordid an Indignity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to his Officers of this Mutilation of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; who, upon conſideration of the Matter of Fact, did unanimouſly declare, That the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> forgetful of them by whoſe Merit they did reign, had deſigned and reſolved to caſheer them, and, by continuing their Seſſion, to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate their Tyranny over the moſt Noble <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                           <pb n="292" facs="tcp:97792:150"/>Nation. Upon theſe Grounds the Army marches into <hi>London,</hi> reſolving to joyn Hands with the Citizens, now Aſſertors of the Publick Liberty, and declare, together with them, for a <hi>Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> as the only Remedy for ſo many Evils. Being thus united, the Souldiers pathetically teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Reſentments, and Sorrow for the Injuries and forced Violence done to that Noble City, which was put upon them againſt their Wills. This happy Conjunction, fill'd the Town and whole Kingdom with ſo univerſal a Joy, that the People demonſtrated their Satisfaction by their Acclamations,<note place="margin">Feb. 9.</note> ringing of their Bells and infinite Bonfires, beſides the roaſting of all manner of <hi>Rumps,</hi> in Contempt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Juncto;</hi> reſounding in theſe Tranſports and glad Ecſtaſies, the Name and Fame of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Mock-Parliament</hi> troubled at this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Change, and forſeeing their infallible Ruin, if <hi>Monk</hi> perſiſted, omitted no Arts, no Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Wiles, Flatteries, Threats, Treaſons, or any other means whereby they might reclaim <hi>Monk</hi> or deſtroy him. It is affirmed, that the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who could ſuffer any <hi>Lord,</hi> but their own, whom they had ſo cruelly offended; offered him the <hi>Protectorate,</hi> upon condition he would not change Party. Which he Prudently, as well as Loyally, refuſed, conſidering, that tho the Employment was magnificent, yet it was very hazardous, the ſtream of the Peoples Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations flowing towards their old Government. It was reported, that <hi>Monſieur Bourdeaux,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> offered the ſame, but, with the ſame ſucceſs, though he had alſo offered the Aſſiſtance of <hi>France</hi> for ſecuring of the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                           <hi>Monk</hi> had given the <hi>juncto,</hi> who had uſurp'd the Power over their Colleagues (they themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce an eight part of the whole) a Day, by which they were to fill their Vacancies with new Elections.

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping Colleagues ſince, was null, and of no effect.</hi> But, theſe Gentlemen being <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently tenacious of their old Principles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned indeed what was done by the <hi>Independants,</hi> but recall'd none of their own Unjuſt <hi>Decrees,</hi> nor voted any thing at preſent in favour of the King. On the contrary, they declare, <hi>That</hi> Charles I. <hi>did firſt raiſe up Arms againſt the</hi> Parliament. They impoſe again, the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> the Root of all our Evils; and Vote, <hi>That none who had born Arms againſt the Parliament, ſhould be admitted in the next Elections.</hi> But withal, they make <hi>Monk</hi> Captain-General of all their Forces; vote the Gates, Portculliſes, Poſts, Chains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the City, to be ſet up again at the Publick Charge; releaſe <hi>Booth</hi> and others out of Priſon; put the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom into good Hands; and having fixed a day for their Diſſolution, as they had been obliged by <hi>Monk,</hi> they appointed a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> to convene in <hi>April</hi> next. Theſe things being done to the Satisfaction of all Men, they further conſtitute a <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> who ſhould govern during the <hi>Interregnum.</hi> And, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:97792:151"/>the Souldiery to <hi>Monk</hi>'s Care and Prudence, they diſſolve themſelves by their own Act and Decree (putting an end to that <hi>Long</hi> and <hi>Bloody Parliament,</hi> which could not be determined but by their own Conſent) after they had exerciſed their Tyranny upon their Fellow-Subjects (beſides the Horrid Murther of their Sovereign) the Space of Nineteen Years; except <hi>Oliver</hi>'s <hi>Quingquennium, Richard</hi>'s ſhort Empire, and <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Ten Weeks domineering.</p>
                        <p>And thus ended that unhappy Parliament, which gave Life and Being to thoſe viperous Factions of Presbytery and Independency; by whoſe violence and impetuous ambition of ruling, they did not only deſtroy the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but Monarchy out of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, involving themſelves in the Ruin of that Parent that begot them.</p>
                        <p>'Tis ſcarce credible, with what exceſs of joy the People, wearied with the continuance of that <hi>Black Parliament,</hi> and freed from the fear of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furrection, entertained the News of its Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Fanaticks</hi> only, and the <hi>Dependants</hi> of the <hi>Hated Juncto,</hi> who left nothing unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the perpetuating the Seſſion of the <hi>Regicides,</hi> were averſe to it. To effect which, they ſolicited Petitions out of the City againſt their Diſſolution; they tempted the Tribunes and Chief Officers, with the uſual Charms of Largeſſes to their Party; they cauſed fictitious Liſts of the <hi>Militia</hi> to be printed. And, when all would not prevail, ſome of them, as St. <hi>Johns</hi> and others, were for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Conditions upon the King (for they no more doubted of his Reſtitution) that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him from acting beyond their pleaſure. But His Majeſty's Rights and Prerogatives, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violablely reſtored to him, by the Prudence and noble Endeavours of <hi>Monk.</hi> This enraged the

                           <hi>Regicides</hi> to that height, that they began now to condemn their own Precipitation and Folly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing themſelves of Madneſs, in that, that they did perſecute <hi>Lambert</hi> ſo raſhly, and unſeaſonably to their own Deſtruction. They now call to mind, how ridiculouſly they had rejected the King's Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Letters preſented them by <hi>Nevil</hi> (who had accidentally received them) wherein they were aſſured of Indignity for all their monſtrous Crimes and Treaſons, if they yet at length would return to their Duty. They therefore, like Men in Deſpair, agitated by the Flagitiouſneſs of their Guilt, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to vindicate their Crimes by attempting great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to try the Matter once more by the Sword. Nor was it long, before an occaſion preſented it ſelf. <hi>Lambert,</hi> who had been impriſoned in the <hi>Tower,</hi> becauſe he had refuſed to give bail for his good Behaviour, had eſcaped thence and appear'd armed about <hi>Northampton.</hi> Some <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and ſeveral disbanded Souldiers repaired to him; all the Fanaticks of the Army being upon the Wing, till ſtay'd with the News of his Defeat.

                        <p>During this Interval of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State</hi> adminiſter'd Affairs with much Prudence and Courage; and, putting out a Proclomation againſt all Diſturbers of the Peace, eaſily reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Seditious Minds of the moſt diſſenting. <hi>Monk</hi> alſo, purging his Army, by the Caſheering of <hi>Fanaticks;</hi> and, living more familiarly with his Officers than uſual, reconciled the moſt fierce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, to an Acquieſcence in the Reſolves of the future <hi>Parliament.</hi> The Diſturbers of our Peace, being thus ſuppreſſed or quieted, the <hi>Loyal Party,</hi> as if indued with new Spirits, put on more
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:97792:152"/>chearful Countenances, and ſhaking off their Fears with their Shackles, appeared more eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. But, being traduced by their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as thirſting after Revenge and Blood, they abundantly demonſtrated by their <hi>Declaration,</hi> their own Innocence, and the Enemies Malice, reſtifying, <hi>That they would leave Vengeance to</hi> God, <hi>and Juſtice to the Diſpoſal of Parliament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now the City of <hi>London</hi> did alſo publiſh a <hi>Declaration,</hi> whereby they endeavoured to clear themſelves from the Guilt of the <hi>Regicide</hi> and <hi>

                        <p>We have hitherto made but little mention of the Particular Actions of our King; for, we would not intermingle the Hiſtory of the <hi>Beſt</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> with that of the <hi>moſt Scelerate</hi> of <hi>Subjects.</hi> We ſhall therefore, deliver the <hi>Series</hi> of his Actions by themſelves, wherein notwithſtanding will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as Extreams do beſt ſhine by Contraries, not only the Eminency of his Vertues, but the Errors, Impieties, Rebellions, Treaſons, Slaughters, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledges, Pride, Rapine and Infamy of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For, what Miſchief did they not commit, and were guilty of?</p>
                        <p>After the King's miraculous Eſcape from <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> through a thouſand Hazards, he at length got ſafe into <hi>France;</hi> being received at <hi>Paris,</hi> as if ſent from <hi>Heaven.</hi> A pregnant Example, of the Care of <hi>Providence</hi> for the Perſons of Kings. That <hi>Monarchy</hi> was actuated then, with well-nigh the ſame Spirit of Diviſion, which had ſo lately diſtracted <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Pariſians</hi> inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Errors of the Government and Evil Counſellors, pointing particularly at <hi>Mazarin</hi>
                           <pb n="297" facs="tcp:97792:152"/>with the ſame Rage and Paſſion, as the <hi>Londoners</hi> did againſt <hi>Strafford.</hi> The Princes were grieved, that a Stranger ſhould be <hi>Firſt Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and would have him therefore removed. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, they raiſed an Army, obtaining Aſſiſtance from <hi>Spain</hi> (that Nation being very offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in helping their Neighbours upon ſuch like Accompts.) Nor did they find King <hi>Lewis</hi> unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, but reſolved to oppoſe them with all his Power. King <hi>Charles</hi> perſwaded <hi>Lewis</hi> and the <hi>Princes,</hi> by his own example, to peace; but, could not prevail, tho he carried himſelf with that Equality, that both ſides were Jealous of his Conduct. For, the <hi>Princes</hi> refuſed to lay down Arms, unleſs the <hi>Cardinal</hi> were removed. And, the King, with the <hi>Queen-Regent,</hi> his Mother, would not have Laws preſcribed to them by their Subjects. The <hi>Princes,</hi> had called the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to their Aid; who alſo entered <hi>France,</hi> with an Army; but returned, upon the Interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of King <hi>Charles,</hi> who had diſcourſed with him about his undertaking the Protection of <hi>Ireland.</hi> This enraged the <hi>Princes</hi> againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> who blamed him much; and the <hi>Pariſians</hi> did dare to calumniate and affront him to that Height, that he was forced to retire to St. <hi>Germains.</hi> Where he alſo, for the moſt part continued, until a League being made betwixt <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and that <hi>Crown</hi> (which he had oppoſed in vain) he was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led again to go into Exile, out of his very Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> had thus long ſerved in the Armies of <hi>France,</hi> with ſuch Bravery and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, particularly in the Battle of <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> that he attracted the Eyes of all Men upon him. And, his behaviour in General, in Court and Camp, were ſo ſignal, that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Longville</hi> would have beſtowed his Daughter upon him, the greateſt
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:97792:153"/>Fortune in <hi>France.</hi> And Marſhal <hi>Turene</hi> being very Sick, recommended him to his King, as the fitteſt Perſon in that Great <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Armies. But, he would not ſtay in <hi>France</hi> after the King his Brother, though he was offered to be <hi>Liuetenant-General</hi> of their Forces in <hi>Italy;</hi> but, leaving that inhoſpitable Land, accepted the Invitation of <hi>Don John,</hi> the Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Low-Countries,</hi> where he largely aſſerted the Glories of his former Actions.</p>
                        <p>The King in his paſſage to <hi>Germany,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Leige</hi> with all imaginable Honour; and, going thence to the <hi>Spaw,</hi> met his Siſter, the <hi>Princoſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> there. Very many Perſons of Quality, as is uſual at the Seaſon, but in unuſal Numbers upon this Occaſion, were come thither out of the Neighbouring Nations, as well to ſee this Royal Congreſs, as to take the Waters. And all of them paid His Majeſty as much Reverence, and Honour, as if he had been their own Natural Prince; or, would have vyed with us, who had the Happineſs then to attend him, in Duty and Obedience, and Veneration for him. He was afterwards received at <hi>Colen</hi> by the Magiſtrates there, which the ſame Teſtimonies of good-will and Eſteem: Where he reſolved to fix his <hi>Court</hi> for ſome Time, as a place delectable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, for his Deſigns. A while after, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his Siſter in her Return to <hi>Holland,</hi> as far as <hi>Duſſeldorp,</hi> where he was magnificently received by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Newburgh,</hi> and treated during his Stay with Hunting and other Royal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements. Being returned to <hi>Cologn,</hi> he found his Brother the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> there, lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>France.</hi> The King had been informed, now he had been thruſt out of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides,</hi> which they had done to ſave the Expence of his Maintenance, and to Ship-wrack his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:97792:153"/>Beſides, it was ſuppoſed, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> had deſigned his Removal, for that ſome in his <hi>Council</hi> had moved his Aſſumption to the <hi>Crown,</hi> as no ways obnoxious or prejudiced by reaſon of his Youth, as is already mentioned. 'Tis ſcarce imaginable, with what Conſtancy he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his <hi>Religion,</hi> however very young. In ſo much, that armed with Inſtructions from the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Couſens,</hi> he eluded the Aſſaults of <hi>Abbot Montague</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Pleſſis,</hi> the one employed by the <hi>Queen-Regent</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Neither the charming Pleaſures of the <hi>French Court,</hi> nor the Purple Dignities of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor yet the extream Severities of the <hi>Queen</hi> his Mother, who did not only refuſe him his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Suſtenance, but denied him the Solace of her Benediction, were of ſtrength to ſhake his <hi>Faith.</hi> Which they yet would endeavour to force, by ſhutting him up in the <hi>Jeſuits Colledge;</hi> if the King his Brother, diſpleaſed with theſe Novelties, had not ſent the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Ormond</hi> to his Reſcue, and to bring him to <hi>Cologn</hi> to him; which he did, though not without Difficulty. But, nothing was impoſſible for this Great Man.</p>
                        <p>After this, the King went to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> famous for its <hi>Marts.</hi> And, in his Progreſs, ſaluted the Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> at <hi>Koningſteyn.</hi> Where, after a Reception worthy Two ſuch great Princes, and ſome private Diſcourſes, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and his Royal Siſter did the ſame. The <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Ormond, Earl</hi> of <hi>Norwich, Lord New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and others of His Majeſty's Train, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo admitted, paid that great <hi>Princeſs</hi> the Reſpects due to her <hi>Highneſs.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her Journey to <hi>Inſprug,</hi> where, after a ſplendid Reception from the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> ſhe made Public Profeſſion of the <hi>Roman Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="300" facs="tcp:97792:154"/>
                        <p>The King leaving <hi>Franckfort,</hi> with the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Acclamations of the People, and thundring of their Cannon, went to <hi>Ments,</hi> whither he had been invited by that <hi>Elector,</hi> where his Reception was truly Royal. And, after three Days Treat, parting with the ſame Magnificence, returned to <hi>Cologn.</hi> Nor did his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſpend the Time idly, whilſt the <hi>Regicides</hi> triumphed in <hi>England.</hi> He had already ſent Embaſſies, to all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> to deſire their Aſſiſtance againſt his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi> But, with little ſucceſs, though the Cauſe were Common. The <hi>French</hi> flouriſhing in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, made a <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>Regicides.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though they ſeemed to grieve at the Murther of the King, were yet the firſt that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and owned this riſing <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> The <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> corrupted with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gold, delivered Sir <hi>Henry Hyde,</hi> the King's Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour at that <hi>Court,</hi> againſt the Law of Nations, into the Hands of the <hi>Parricides;</hi> who Murthered him, by cutting off his Head before the <hi>Exchange. Swedeland</hi> was then in an unſetled Condition. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> unable, being attacked both by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Indies. Poland</hi> was worried with her own Domeſtick Diſtractions. <hi>Denmark</hi> was exhauſted, with the Treaſure formerly lent to <hi>Charles</hi> I. Others indeed, reſtified their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wills, by their Contributions; as, the <hi>Great Duke</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> the <hi>Electors</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> by the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s negoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Ratisbone.</hi> But, what could this import, to make a new and great War? Whereas, it ſcarce ſufficed, to defray the Charges of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>
                        <p>The King then ſeeing no Hopes of his Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from abroad, wiſely ſought a Remedy where the Wound was received, from the Benevolence
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:97792:154"/>and Loyalty of his Subjects, which the Eminence of his Vertues could not in Juſtice refuſe him. Neither was he any way wanting to himſelf, but moſt intent upon all Occaſions; leaving nothing unattempted, whereby he might raiſe his ſinking Affairs.</p>
                        <p>He kept conſtant Correſpondence with his Friends in <hi>England.</hi> Caus'd great Diſturbances to the <hi>Rebels</hi> on every ſide, and expoſing himſelf to the Danger, did more than once incite the People to arm againſt the Uſurpers. He now kept his <hi>Court</hi> at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> nearer hand, having been invited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> repenting their too early Compliments to the <hi>Regicides,</hi> and ſupplied with 9000 <hi>
                              <abbr>l.</abbr> per annum;</hi> which Money was punctually repaid upon His <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Reſtitution. The <hi>Duke,</hi> in the mean Time, having recalled all the Kings Subjects in the <hi>French</hi> Service, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with thoſe in the <hi>Spaniſh Low-Countries,</hi> compoſed a conſiderable Body; which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, with no leſs Honour than he had done in <hi>France,</hi> although they were well nigh deſtroyed by the fatal Valour of the <hi>Engliſh Rebels</hi> at <hi>Mardike</hi> and the Battle of <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by Misfortunes, did not only for ſome time reſiſt, but retard the Progreſs of the Victors; until oppreſſed by multitudes, as is already ſaid, he was neceſſitated to comply with the Fate of the vanquiſhed. <hi>Cromwell</hi> dying ſoon after, however a way ſeemed thereby to be opened to the Kings Reſtauration, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> received the News of it with remarkable Conſtancy and Calmneſs of Mind, in no ways inſulting, though he ſaw his moſt Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy extinguiſhed in the Perſon of this <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper. Cardinal Mazarin,</hi> however averſe to King <hi>Charles,</hi> did at the ſame time congratulate the <hi>Queen</hi> his Mother, upon the Hopes of her Sons Reſtauration, ſince he was, by the Death of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:97792:155"/>that Tyrant, delivered from his moſt implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſucceſsful Enemy.</p>
                        <p>The ſudden Change in <hi>England,</hi> followed by the Depoſing of <hi>Richard,</hi> and the Reſurrection of the <hi>Rump,</hi> and the other Innovations already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, which followed; as they augmented the Hopes of the King at Home, ſo they varied the Counſels of Princes abroad: Which his Majeſty applyed, in as much as was poſſible, to his own Uſe, by Negotiations and Embaſſies. But there being now a <hi>Treaty</hi> in Agitation betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> he would himſelf be preſent at it. For, if a Peace were concluded, which was more than probable, betwixt theſe great Princes, it was but reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they might ſpare ſome of their numerous Forces to aſſiſt an injured King, their Ally by Blood, and Common Intereſt. And yet, the King would rather reduce his Rebel-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to Obedience, by the Appearance of his Power, than by the Uſe of his Forces. In the mean time, accompanied with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> his Brother, and the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> he haſted <hi>Incognito</hi> through <hi>France,</hi> having ſaluted the Queen his Mother at <hi>Paris,</hi> in his way to St. <hi>John De Luz,</hi> where the Great Miniſters of the Two <hi>Crowns</hi> were then in <hi>Treaty. Don Louis de Haro,</hi> upon Notice of the Kings Approach, went to met and receive him. Which he did (alighting from his Horſe, and Embracing and kiſſing his Knees) with as much Honour and Splendour, as if he had been his Maſter the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The next Day, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> was viſited by <hi>Cardinal Mazarin,</hi> the other great <hi>Plenipotentiary,</hi> who was courtly, though reſerved. And yet, the King behaved himſelf with ſo much charming Prudence to both theſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and gained ſo much upon them, that he not only defeated the Deſigns of <hi>Lockhart,</hi> the <hi>Regicides</hi> Embaſſadour then there,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:97792:155"/>but having obtained an Aſſurance of being aſſiſted by the Forces of the Two <hi>Crowns</hi> for his Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was diſmiſſed with the ſame Honours he had been received. At <hi>Paris</hi> in his Return, he was ſplendidly treated by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> as King of <hi>England;</hi> and acknowledged ſuch by all Men, none now doubting, of his ſudden Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. From thence, he came to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that City publickly, and with a Pomp worthy his Grandeur, where he alſo was magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently careſſed, and where he deſigned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue until the Diſſolution of the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whilſt theſe things were in Agitation, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and Riſings in <hi>England</hi> were various; the Impatience of the <hi>Royal Party</hi> to reſtore their <hi>Prince,</hi> precipitating them, as uſually, into great Inconveniencies. And yet, they got to a Head in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> under Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> as is already mentioned; and, the King himſelf was in private about St. <hi>Malos,</hi> attending ſome favourable Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to tranſport him into <hi>England.</hi> Theſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, eſpecially <hi>Booth</hi>'s, were lookt upon as formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, it being ſuppoſed, that <hi>Monk</hi> was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with them. But, they being ſuppreſt every where, the King returned again to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> in expectation of the event of the Pacification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt the <hi>Two Crowns.</hi> He had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long there, when being informed of the Differences betwixt the Army and <hi>Rump,</hi> his Hopes being raiſed thereby, he took alſo a Reſolution not to be wanting in himſelf. He had tryed the ways of War, and had alſo attempted the perfidious Fidelity of his Enemies, but with no Succeſs. He will therefore, put himſelf upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counſels: And ſeeing <hi>Monk</hi> commanded the <hi>Rebels</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Chief, he will enquire into the Secret of his Intentions and Mind. The King had found him a ſharp Enemy, but Noble; free
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97792:156"/>from Calumnies and Revilings, nor any way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained with the inexpiable Guilt of the <hi>Regicide.</hi> In the former Wars, he had ſerved King <hi>Charles</hi> I. but being taken, and perhaps neglected, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Liberty before Confinement, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Arms to the clinking of Shackles. It was therefore thought expedient, to attempt him under theſe Circumſtances, and endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him with the Charms and Honour of being the <hi>Deliverer</hi> of his <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> Sir <hi>John Greenvill,</hi> eminent for his Loyalty, and of kin to <hi>Monk,</hi> was employed to manage this important Secret. Who in order to it, having gained Mr. <hi>Nicolas Monk,</hi> a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the <hi>General's</hi> Brother, on whom, as <hi>Patron,</hi> he had beſtowed a very conſiderable Benefice, he ſent him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Commiſſion, in the King's Name, to offer him any Conditions he ſhould pleaſe to Demand. But, <hi>Monk</hi> wiſely ſuſpicious, under pretence of the incertain Viciſſitudes of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, anſwered ambiguouſly, neither openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his ſentiments nor wholly concealing them. He alſo, having exacted an Oath of ſecreſie from his Brother, ſent him back with his Daughter, which was the Pretext for his coming into <hi>Scotland;</hi> as alſo, a Meſſage to the Members outed by <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> to aſſure them of his Fidelity to the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</hi> Theſe Gentlemen, raiſed with theſe Hopes, preſumed all things upon that Accompt, and was a plauſible Vail for him in the modelling and forming his Army, according to his Deſigns. But <hi>Greenvill</hi> being not well ſatisfied with the Parſon's Declaration, acquainted the King with it. Who, notwithſtanding the Abſtruſeneſs of it, drew no ill Augury thence, commanding <hi>Greenvil</hi> to attend the <hi>General</hi> when he came to <hi>London,</hi> and make all imaginable Enquiry, of what Intentions he was towards His Majeſty's Reſtitution. And, this he
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:97792:156"/>happily performed, being admitted by the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Mr. <hi>Morrice,</hi> a great Confident of <hi>Monk</hi>'s, and afterwards <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State</hi> to the King. The Enterview was in <hi>Morrice</hi> his Chamber; where, no Body but themſelves being preſent, <hi>Greenvill</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <hi>Monk</hi> the King's Letters. To which, after Twice reading of them, he anſwered, <hi>That he would not only comply with the King's Deſires, but alſo reſtore him without Conditions, or any the leaſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of his Royal Authority.</hi> Neither would he think of any Terms for himſelf, humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that to the King's Pleaſure when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. <hi>Greenvill</hi> ecſtaſi'd with the Joy of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, deſired Letters to the King, to teſtifie ſo great a Secret; but he replied, That he would commit nothing to Writing, nor ſend any Body to the King beſides himſelf, whom he had found ſo faithful and ſecret. He hoped, His Majeſty would Pardon what was paſt, profeſſing, <hi>That he always had a Veneration for the King, and now upon this firſt Occaſion would teſtifie his Obedience to him, with the Hazard of his Life and Fortune. Greenvill</hi> overjoyed with this happy Concluſion, haſtened to acquaint the King with it at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely pleaſed with <hi>Monk's</hi> generous Actings; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, having received Letters out of <hi>England</hi> from ſome Friends there, deſiring him to accept of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wights</hi> Conditions, they being the beſt they could at preſent procure him. But, <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> was, by Advice of Sir <hi>Edward Hyde</hi> (then made <hi>Chancellour</hi>) and the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> preſently returned into <hi>England,</hi> with a <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> for <hi>Monk,</hi> as <hi>General</hi> of all the Forces in the Three Kingdoms; and, a Letter all writ with the King's own Hand, full of gracious Expreſſions and Acknowledgments for ſo great a Benefit. <hi>Greenvill</hi> had alſo other Letters, which we ſhall mention in their Place. And, leſt he might himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:97792:157"/>empty, after he had been ſo ſignally meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, the King honoured him with a Warrant for an <hi>Earldom</hi> and 3000 <abbr>

                        <p>Whilſt theſe things were in Agitation, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> obſerving that the Treaty betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> upon the Borders, would end in a Peace, ſhewed themſelves likewiſe not averſe to it; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering, the vaſt Commerce they always had with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Countries. Hence followed, a ſpontaneous Ceſſation from Arms. But, the King would not expect the Event of it, for fear of being impoſed upon here as he had been in <hi>France;</hi> and therefore, removed his <hi>Court</hi> to <hi>Breda,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Siſter the <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange.</hi> The ſudden Change in <hi>England,</hi> occaſioned Changes of Councils. And, now it was ſuppoſed that the King ſhould take ſhipping from <hi>Calais,</hi> or ſome Part in <hi>Flanders,</hi> having been earneſtly invited thereto from both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> But, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent both he accepted of neither, but continued at <hi>Breda,</hi> cluding thereby the Arts of both Princes, the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns, as well as thoſe of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> longing for the return of <hi>Jamaica</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi> to their Obedience. The King then being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure at <hi>Breda,</hi> was ſaluted there by Deputies from the <hi>States-General,</hi> where he was alſo magnificently treated by the Publick.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> being now met, conſiſting of <hi>Two Houſes,</hi> free, and full in their Numbers, their firſt Care was to give Publick Thanks to <hi>God</hi> for reſcuing their Country from Uſurpation and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; and, the next, to thank the <hi>General,</hi> who by his Courage and Conduct had contributed ſo mainly to it.

And, ſince the armed Violence and other Calamities of many Years laſt paſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have hitherto deprived us of any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, wherein we might expreſs our Loyalty and Allegiance to his</hi> Majeſty: <hi>We therefore, the</hi> Lords <hi>and</hi> Commons <hi>now aſſembled in</hi> Parliament <hi>together with the Lord</hi> Mayor, Aldermen <hi>and</hi> Common Council <hi>of the City of</hi> London, <hi>and other Freemen of this Kingdom now preſent, do, according to our Duty and Allegiance, heartily, joyfully, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly acknowledge and Proclaim, That immediately upon the Deceaſe of our late Sovereign, King</hi> Charles I. <hi>the Imperial Crown of the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and all the Kingdoms, Dominions and Rights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſame, did by inherent Birth-right, and lawful, undoubted Succeſſion, deſcend and come to his moſt Excellent</hi> Majeſty, <hi>King</hi> Charles II. <hi>as being Lineally, Juſtly and Lawfully, next Heir of the Blood Royal of this Realm. And, that by the Goodneſs and Providence of</hi> Almighty God, <hi>He is of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>the moſt Potent, Mighty and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted King, and thereunto we moſt humbly

                        </p>
                        <p>At the Ceremony of this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> the Publick Joy expreſſed by Shoutings, Acclamations of <hi>God bleſs the King,</hi> Bells and Bonfires, were no leſs extraordinary than infinite, the People being at length redeemed out of ſo long and ſo wretched a Captivity, by the miraculous Reſtauration of their Beloved Prince.</p>
                        <p>Our moſt Auguſt <hi>Monarch,</hi> had hitherto, as is already mentioned, wandered in Foreign <hi>Courts,</hi> and as uſual in the Diſgraces of Fortune, too much neglected; eſpecially, where Reaſon of State ſeemed more prevalent, than all the Tyes of Blood or Hoſpitality. He was at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> when he firſt heard of this Change in <hi>England;</hi> from whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Breda,</hi> a more ſecure place under the Circumſtances of the preſent Times. And, now he haſtens <hi>Greenvill</hi> away again, with Letters to the <hi>Two Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to the City, to <hi>Monk,</hi> and to <hi>Montague,</hi> joynt General at Sea. In theſe Writings, <hi>He Pardons all Men and all Crimes, committed againſt his Royal Father or himſelf;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>ſuch as the</hi> Parliament <hi>ſhould except againſt;</hi> promiſing further; <hi>The Souldiers their Arrears tho' they bore Arms againſt him;</hi> and, <hi>That he would from that time receive them into his own Trust and Service, upon the ſame Terms they did now enjoy,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Declaration</hi> being received and read in <hi>Parliament,</hi> with inexpreſſible Satisfaction and Joy, was voted infinitely Satisfactory, and a ſplendid Embaſſy ordered to the forthwith ſent to the King, with their humble Thanks for his Gracious <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and Letters; and, to invite and preſs His <hi>Majeſty's</hi> return, to his Parliament and People. Six <hi>Lords</hi> and Twelve <hi>Commoners,</hi> with Twenty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Citizens, with a noble Train of Attendants,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97792:158"/>were ſent upon this happy Occaſion.

The Embaſſadours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted to the King's Preſence and graciouſly heard, had their Deſires crowned with a wiſht-for Anſwer. So, that nothing now impeded His <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Return to his Dominions, but the Wind, which in favour to the kind <hi>Dutch,</hi> kept him ſome little time longer there. In the <hi>interim,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> viſited the Fleet, lying at Anchor before <hi>Scheveling,</hi> under the Command of General <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> formerly (as is mentioned) reconciled to His <hi>Majeſty.</hi> After a magnificent Reception, his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> taking the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> from the Sea-men, and having changed the Names of ſeveral of the Prime Ships, reſtored this firſt Pledge of <hi>Empire</hi> to our <hi>Monarch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The King having taken his Leave of the <hi>States General,</hi> and of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> in their Aſſemblies (the Honour of which viſit they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in a moſt Elegant Speech, with all the Expreſſions of Gratitude and Satisfaction) he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in a Boat, prepared for him by the <hi>States,</hi> whoſe Flag had this memorable Inſcription,
<q>Quo Fas et Fata vocârunt.</q>
The Ways, the Downs, the Sand Hills and Shores, were crowded with an innumerable Multitude of all Sorts of People, ecchoing his Departure with Vows for his good Succeſs. By the way, upon the Approach of a Brigandine from the Fleet, he entered into it. And, going aboard the <hi>Royal Charles,</hi> formerly the <hi>Naesby,</hi> with his <hi>Two Royal Brothers,</hi> the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> he was

                        <p>The Anchors being at length weighed, he left this friendly Shore, with the thundering of the Cannon on both ſides, and ſailed towards <hi>England,</hi> now truely his own. On the 25th of <hi>May,</hi> he came into <hi>Dover</hi> Road; where, upon his landing, he was received by <hi>Monk</hi> with Joy and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. This beſt of Servants, had thrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his Knees, to adore this beſt of Maſters. But, the King not forgetful of what he owed him, took him up, embraced him and kiſt him. Other Noble Men and Perſons of Quality there preſent, were likewiſe admitted to the Honour of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Hand.

And, it was time, ſeeing they deſigned, not only to retrench his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> but alſo to ſeize his Perſon.

But <hi>College</hi> being brought before another Tribunal, leſs ſubjected to the Authority of the Faction, received ſuch Puniſhment as his Treaſon deſerved. He had no leſs offended at <hi>Oxford,</hi> than at <hi>London,</hi> and was try'd and executed there. The Fellow was of the Lees of the Rabble, a Joyner by
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:97792:167"/>Trade; vain, reſtleſs, inquiſitive, and perpetually buſie in Affairs that leaſt concerned him. But, <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Fortune was better, who eluding the Publick Juſtice, by a <hi>Jury</hi> addicted to himſelf and the Faction, and retorting the Danger upon his Accuſers, triumphed, whilſt they hardly eſcaped the Fury of the Rabble. And 'twas no wonder; for, this deſtructive <hi>Faction</hi> was ſo prevalent in the City, that it had infatuated the People and the Companies of Tradeſmen, with a reverent Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Sanctity; And, ſpreading wider, the Contagion had diffuſed it ſelf into moſt of the Provinces of the Kingdom. And now, all ſuch whoſe Crimes had rendered them Guilty, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence bold; ſuch whoſe Zeal made furious, or Ambition lofty, joyned themſelves to them. The ſame Pretences of Liberty, Property and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and the ſame Methods wherewith the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> had been involved in Blood and Confuſion, were now again made uſe of, moſtly by the ſame Men; cunning, reſtleſs and implacable, to ſeduce weak and irreſolute Perſons, as alſo to diſturb that Peace, which we hitherto enjoyed to the Envy of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By ſuch Inſtruments, the mildeſt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was branded with the Name of Tyranny; The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is traduced, and the faithfulleſt Miniſters and Servants to the King and Crown, calumniated with Male Adminiſtration. In the mean Time, Schiſm and Sedition are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where promoted; Jealouſies and vain Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are ſuggeſted; proditorious Diſcourſes and infamous Libels are ſcattered about; and things abhorring from <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> are dayly exerciſed, under the genuine Veil of <hi>Proteſtantiſm.</hi> Finally, the old Opinions and Doctrines of the <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticks,</hi> ſo ruinous to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> are now again coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:97792:167"/>and aſſerted with the ſame Fierceneſs and Confidence, as they had been in the late Rebellion.</p>
                        <p>With theſe pickeerings of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> they gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proceeded to Action. Parties are diſtinguiſhed. Names and Signs of Separation are diſtributed. Unlawful Conventicles, in deſpite of the Laws are patroniſed. Tumultuous Banquets, and factious Clubs are every where ſet up. Clandeſtine and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Aſſemblies are frequented. Unuſual Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Arms, are bought up by private Men. Inſolent Progreſſes are made through the Country, to the End they might ſhew how numerous they were, ſpread their Terror about as they moved, diſcover their Party, and demonſtrate their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon all Occaſions.</p>
                        <p>Nor were theſe Caballings unknown to the King, who when he ſaw his Clemency ſo highly abuſed, by thoſe whom he had pardoned yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Offences, reſolved to chaſtiſe them, and oppoſe the ſeverity of Law to their Extravagancies. In the Two preceding Years, Two Favourers of the Faction being <hi>Lord Mayors</hi> by Turn, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted turbulent Fellows to the <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and chief Employments in the City. Of theſe, the Two <hi>Sheriffs</hi> were chief, who directed the choice of <hi>Jury's</hi> at pleaſure, which gave the licentious Liberty to offend: For, what durſt they not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, who were certain of Impunity?</p>
                        <p>But, the King reſolved at length to ſtem this growing Evil. Which he did, by reſtoring the Free Election of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Cuſtom, and taking the Forfeiture of the City-Charter, adjudged ſo by Law, into his own Hands. Theſe means, however proper for the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> had like to have deſtroyed both. For, when ſo many Criminals and Wicked-doers ſaw the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> changed.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:97792:168"/>and honeſt Men put into their Places; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that there was no Evaſion from the Law, under pretence of it, they reſolve upon a high At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and worthy their Helliſh Conſpiracy; which was, to ſubvert the King and Kingdom, and involve them in the ſame Ruin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> being conſcious of his Guilt, and not ignorant of the Injuſtice of the <hi>Sentence</hi> by which he eſcaped, terrified with the unexpected Change, and ſeeing himſelf obnoxious to that Juſtice which he had fruſtrated and eluded; moved with the greater Precipitation, he terrifies his Aſſociates with the Greatneſs of the Danger, encourages ſome to riſe, others to Parricide, reſolving to hazard all rather than tamely betray himſelf into the Hands of his Enemies. He therefore exhorts his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, <hi>To vindicate their Liberty, Property, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> [the old Cant ſtill] <hi>againſt Popery, Tyranny, Superſtition, Idolatry, Oppreſſion, Murther, and the other growing Evils of Servitude.</hi> With theſe kind of Orations, they incenſe the furious. So that, what they could not effect by Fraud and pretended Sanctity, they reſolve to compaſs by the way of Arms. To this End, they adviſe about raiſing of Forces. But <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> thinking they moved not ſwiftly enough in it, impatient of every Delay, and fearing (for every Noiſe alarm'd him) of being intercepted, as he had already withdrawn himſelf from his own Dwelling, exagitated with his own Guilt, he fled the Kingdom, and retreated into <hi>Holland.</hi> Where, this moſt torbulent of Men being neglected, found that Repoſe in Death, which the impetuous Deſire of Ruling had deprived him of here.</p>
                        <p>The Conſpirators however troubled at the loſs of ſo eminent a Patron, and not ignorant that they were advanced beyond a Retreat, conſtitute a Supream <hi>Council of Six,</hi> to manage their Affairs.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:97792:168"/>Beſides this, they had another more Inferiour <hi>Court,</hi> who conſulted how to remove the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> by Aſſaſſination or otherwiſe, and to ſolicite the Revolt of the Commonalty in Order to a War; which they reſolve to carry on, againſt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> The <hi>Scots,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Arguile,</hi> were invited to joyn, and act in this nefarious Rebellion: Who had alſo their Commiſſioners at <hi>London,</hi> who together with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſpirators, ſhould move by conſent. And, it was concerted amongſt them, that they ſhould break out into open Hoſtility in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms at the ſame Time.</p>
                        <p>They reſolve to ſecure <hi>London,</hi> the Head of their Deſign, by the ſame Methods it had been circumvented in the former Rebellion. They further, divide the City into Twenty Parts, which they diſtributed under the Conduct of ſo many Commanders. Some were to ſeize the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the principal Poſts in the City; others <hi>White-hall,</hi> and particularly the Guards which were to be ſurprized and cut off. They had a Hundred of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Officers at hand, ready to head the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon their Inſurrection, being abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Money and Arms by voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions from the Chiefs of their Party. The Country was no leſs addicted to them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe Parts which <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from his Baniſhment without Permiſſion, had viſited in his Progreſſes.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt they thus prepare for War, the Deſign to Murther the King and Duke, kept pace with them. <hi>Hone,</hi> another Godly Joyner, propoſed to have them ſhot from <hi>Bow ſteeple</hi> as they paſſed, with Croſs-Bows. <hi>Rumbald</hi> the Maltſter, would have the Play-Houſe blown up with Gun-powder when they were preſent, declaring further, That he he had laid a Deſign Ten Years ago to have ſlain
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:97792:169"/>them, as they returned from <hi>New-Market,</hi> if they had not by accident taken another way, whereby they eſcaped the Danger. Some deſigned to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt them as they walked in St. <hi>James</hi>'s-<hi>Park,</hi> which they frequently did with no great Train. Some fancied it eaſie to ſink them in the River, when they took the Air by Water in their Barge, by ſhocking them with a greater Veſſel. There were again others, who would have them piſtol'd in the <hi>Play-Houſe,</hi> whilſt intent upon the <hi>Comedy,</hi> or kill'd as they came thence along <hi>Bedford-wall.</hi> Other places betwixt <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> about <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Red-Lyon Fields,</hi> if they ſhould come there, were judged proper enough for this black Parricide. But theſe all, as ſubject to too much Hazard and Danger, were laid aſide upon mature Deliberation, of the more convenient Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the <hi>Rye,</hi> a Houſe belonging to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Rumbald</hi> ſeated, in the Way to <hi>New-Market,</hi> Eighteen Miles from <hi>London,</hi> in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> This Place being Moated about, and the Paſſage near it narrow and ſtrongly fenced and wall'd, was judged the moſt proper of any for the Purpoſe; <hi>Rumbald</hi> himſelf, the Deſigner of this Wickedneſs, offering in Perſon to undertake it with Forty more Aſſociates, and at once to deſtroy both the <hi>Royal Brothers.</hi> Which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably effected, if <hi>God,</hi> the Protector of Kings, had not wrought a Miracle in their Favour.</p>
                        <p>The Conſpirators full of Hopes and Aſſurance, ſeemed in nowiſe to queſtion the Succeſs of their ſo well laid Enterprize, when the <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> diſappointed in a moment all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances and Plots, by a Fire undoubtedly ſent from Heaven, which burnt a great part of <hi>New-Market.</hi> The Conflagration was ſo terrible, that the Flames of it approaching the King's Pallace, forced him thence, to another part of the Town
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:97792:169"/>further off. Where, by reaſon of the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his Lodgings, he propoſed to paſs ſome days more in Hunting, and the other uſual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of the Place. But, he had no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it, but the Wind, conducted by ſome <hi>Inviſible Agent,</hi> ſuddenly changing, fills his new Lodgings in a moment with Smoke and Cynders. Which obliged the King, ſeeing no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience for his Reception, to declare, That he would immediately return to <hi>White hall;</hi> which he alſo did, before he was expected, or that the Conſpirators Preparations were in a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</p>
                        <p>The Noiſe of ſo unexpected an Accident, was diverſly received by the <hi>Parricides.</hi> Some believed, <hi>That ſo unuſual Burnings, could not happen without the Direction of</hi> Providence. <hi>Walcot</hi> profeſs'd, that he thence conjectured, <hi>That</hi> God <hi>did not approve of their Deſign.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> without any the leaſt Horror of ſo helliſh an Undertaking, did dare to affirm, <hi>That he plainly ſaw, that</hi> God <hi>had reſerved the King for his own Judgment.</hi> And yet one of theſe Conſpirators, <hi>Keeling</hi> by Name, a Schiſmatic, greatly addicted to the Faction, and number'd amongſt the Forty Murtherers, perceiving the Averſeneſs of Heaven, and agitated with the Terrors and Storms of a Guilty Conſcience, after many Combats in his Soul, reſolved at length to disburthen himſelf, by diſcovering this Tartareous Secret to the King. At firſt, the Monſtrouſneſs of ſo horrid a Deſign, diſcountenanced the Credit of the Relator, until verified by demonſtrative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which gave Opportunity to the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators to withdraw themſelves. Yet, ſome of them were taken, as <hi>Howard, Eſſex, Ruſſel, Rumſey, Sidney, Walcot, Hone, Rowſe,</hi> and the Lord <hi>G.</hi> but, he eſcaped out of the hands of the Meſſenger. The Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and Collonel <hi>Sydney</hi>
                           <pb n="332" facs="tcp:97792:170"/>were both beheaded. <hi>Walcot, Rowſe</hi> and <hi>Hone</hi> were executed at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> and, others in other places, ſuffered the puniſhments due to ſuch execrable Treaſons. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the unfortunate Son of a good Father, by his own hands prevented the Kings Clemency, who could not ſhew the utmoſt of his Severity, againſt a Son of my <hi>Lord Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of thoſe who fled, ſome obtained the Kings Pardon by their ingenious Confeſſions, as <hi>Barber, Blaney, Bourn, How, Howard, Rumſey,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is it unworthy of Notice, that ſcarce any of thoſe who were executed, did dye, without confeſſing enough to demonſtrate their Crime, though not their Repentance.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt the Fugitives, the moſt conſiderable were <hi>Armſtrong, Ayloff, Burton,</hi> the Two <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughs</hi> Brothers, <hi>Gray, Holloway, Norton, Nizbet, Row,</hi> the Two <hi>Rombalds</hi> Brothers, <hi>Smyth, Wade, Tyley</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> the Shame of his Coat and Calling, a Canting Teacher, and more cruelly wicked than all thoſe he had endeavoured to miſlead. Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> and <hi>Holloway,</hi> being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the Firſt at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> the other at <hi>Mevis,</hi> one of our <hi>Weſtern</hi> Plantations, and brought into <hi>England,</hi> were both executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Merit of their Crimes.</p>
                        <p>The Parricide deſigned thus in <hi>England,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>Duke,</hi> being diſcovered and prevented, the <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> fell alſo, as depending on it. <hi>James Stuart, Monroe, Melvin, Cockran, Bayley, Caſtares, Spence, Alex. Gordon, Nezbet,</hi> &amp;c. were the Chief of the Party, acting in all Things by Agreement with <hi>Argile.</hi> This perverſe Son of a wicked Father, had Demanded 30000 <abbr>
                              <hi>l.</hi>
                           </abbr> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to buy Arms, engaging himſelf to make a powerful Diverſion in his own Country. Which he alſo effected, as we ſhall
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:97792:170"/>ſee hereafter, having procured Supplies by other means.</p>
                        <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> youthfully raſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, ambitious, and hurried on with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of vindicating <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> agitated now with the Guilt of his Crimes, had alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf. But, being proſcribed, and finding but little ſafety in a Retreat, though it his beſt courſe to implore that Clemency which he had ſo cruelly offended. Which he did by his Letters, ſeemingly full of Ingenuity, wherein he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his Crimes of Unfaithfulneſs againſt the King, and of Ingratitude to the <hi>Duke;</hi> bewailing what he had done, and humbly ſupplicating Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for what was paſt. With Imprecations of Vengeance upon himſelf, if he offended any more, or violated the Promiſes he then made of his future Fidelity. The King, the mildeſt of Princes, moved with his Submiſſions, anſwered him under his own Hand in theſe Terms, <hi>That if the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Monmouth <hi>would render himſelf capable of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it was neceſſary he ſhould ſurrender himſelf into the Hands of Secretary</hi> Jenkins, <hi>and ſhould tell His Majeſty all that he knew, ſubmitting himſelf as to the reſt entirely to his Pleaſure.</hi> This peremptory Declaration of the King's Will, extorted other Letters from <hi>Monmouth,</hi> wherein, <hi>he pathetical<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He declares, that his Crimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him with ſo terrible an Aſpect, that he would rather dye than be tormented with their ſtings; he therefore implores the King's Grace and Pardon, which he did not deſire, but by the Mediation of his</hi> Royal Highneſs. He further profeſſes, <hi>That he
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:97792:171"/>ſaith this ſeriouſly and ſincerely, not only ſubmitting himſelf for this Time to the King's Pleaſure, but for his whole Life.</hi> Concluding, <hi>That he ſhould be the unhappieſt of Men, until he were raiſed with a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and mild Anſwer.</hi>

                        <p>The King after this,<note place="margin">1683.

The King moved with ſo great Arrogance, and perceiving that <hi>Monmouth</hi> did continue his Society with thoſe who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his unwary Youth, after ſome Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, he commanded him to publiſh in Writing, what he had declared to himſelf and to the <hi>Duke</hi> his Brother. Nor did he refuſe it, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the King in theſe Terms. <hi>That he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that it had been reported of him, as if he had deſigned to extenuate the late Conſpiracy, and traduce the Testimonies against them that ſuffered. His</hi> Majeſty <hi>and the</hi> Duke <hi>knew, how ingeniouſly he confeſſed all Things, and that he was not conſcious of the least Evil againſt his</hi> Majeſty's <hi>Life. It grieved him however, that he had ſo greatly countenanced the ſaid Conſpiracy. He would publiſh this for his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, beſeeching his</hi> Majeſty <hi>not to look back,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:97792:171"/>but that he would pleaſe to forget thoſe Injuries which he had forgiven.

                        <p>But, theſe Flouriſhes were no leſs fickle, than ſhort-liv'd. For, the unhappy Youth, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht by the Artifices of wicked Men, and his own Ambition, broke that Faith which he had ſo ſolemnly promiſed to preſerve inviolable. For, being fooliſhly perſwaded, That the Declaration he had ſo lately made, was a Diminution to his Honour, and might riſe up in Judgment againſt him hereafter, he redemanded it from his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:</hi> Who, tender of his Good, endeavoured to divert him from ſo prepoſterous an Attempt; but, being more obſtinately preſſed, he in great Anger reſtored it him, baniſhing him at the ſame time from his <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Preſence.</hi>

From hence they marched to <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water;</hi> and, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> from <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to <hi>Weſton,</hi> where he encamped, Three Miles diſtant from the <hi>Rebels.</hi> The Horſe and Dragoons lay in the Town, and the Foot in the Field, covered towards the Campaign with a Parapet and Trench, formerly made by the Country-men againſt Inundations; and, their Rear was ſecured, by the ſaid Village behind them. Towards Evening it was told my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> that the <hi>Rebels</hi> were ſtirring, in Order to march. Whereupon, he ſent frequent Scouts out to learn News of them. But, <hi>Monmouth</hi> eluding the ſaid Scouts, enters unobſerved, and with great Silence, into the Plain before the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> Trench. Where drawing up his Army, which conſiſted of Six Thouſand Foot, and having entruſted the Lord <hi>G.</hi> with the Horſe, which amounted to Twelve Hundred, he marched in Battle-Array againſt the Adverſary. The alarm being taken, the <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> conſiſting only of the Guards and part of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barton</hi>'s Regiment, were quickly ready to receive them. The Fight began with great ſhouts, and brisk firing. The aforeſaid Dike being in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Parapet, was of great uſe to the <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> which occaſioned the Enemies ſhot, as being aimed higher, to five for the moſt part over their Heads; whilſt they, as being more expoſed in the open Field, were more directly armed at and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The <hi>L. G.</hi> haſtening with his Horſe to the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Foot, looſing his way in the Night, fell
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:97792:177"/>unexpectedly upon a Party of the <hi>Royalliſts.</hi> Which he endeavoured to avoid, by wheeling from them. But turned upon his own Men, who thinking he ran away, did effectually do ſo themſelves; and, filling all with Fear and Confuſion, the whole Horſe were broke and routed, and that without a Blow; every one ſhifting for himſelf, and ſearching his Safety in his Flight inſtead of fighting. The Foot ſtood bravely to it, until attacked by our Horſe, at length come up, in Flank and Rear; as alſo, our great Guns beginning to play upon them, they ſeeing themſelves abandoned by their <hi>Cavalry,</hi> were alſo broke, routed and ſlaughtered. The ſlain on the <hi>Rebels</hi> ſide, amounted to near Two Thouſand, beſides many taken. Collonel <hi>Holmes,</hi> Major <hi>Perrot, Crookhorn</hi> and other unknown Names, were made Priſoners. There were alſo taken, Three Field-Pieces, and Six and Twenty Colors. Of the King's ſide Three Hundred were ſlain, and many wounded. And, undoubtedly the loſs would have been greater, but for the fore-mentioned Breaſt-work, the <hi>Rebels</hi> ſo far out-numbering them.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after this Victory, <hi>Feverſham</hi> marched with Five Hundred Men to <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> the <hi>Rebels</hi> next Station. Which he poſſeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of without Reſiſtance, they diſperſing and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Advance. And, here he left Collonel <hi>Kirk,</hi> to compoſe the Diſorders of the Town.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Gray</hi> ſeeing all loſt, eſcaped out of the Battle; and changing their Veſtments, ſought where beſt to conceal themſelves. But, the Lord G. was taken in the diſguiſe of a Shepherd, one other only being in company with him; and, being brought to the L. <hi>Lumley,</hi> he was diſcovered at firſt ſight, being alſo known by a Servant of the ſaid Lord's, who had formerly been his Groom. So that, putting off his Diſguiſe, he profeſſed, <hi>That ſince his landing in</hi> England, <hi>he had never had one good
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:97792:177"/>Nights Reſt, or eat one Meal in quiet.</hi> Nor is it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being perpetually agitated with the perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and cares which accompany unfortunate Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
                        <p>Two Days after, <hi>Monmouth</hi> himſelf fell into the Hands of his Purſuers. The Immenſneſs of the Rewards, raiſed the Country in the ſearch; ſo that, the Ways and Woods were filled with their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Some went out by break of Day, and taking a Dog with them, as Men uſually do in Hunting Beaſts of Prey, the Dog made the firſt Diſcovery of one hid in a Ditch, who proving to be a Foreigner (which appeared by his broken Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) and threatningly required to tell where <hi>Monmouth</hi> was, pointed at his Covert; whither they immediately went, and there ſeized this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happieſt of Men, in great Diſtraction, pale, trembling and full of Diſorder. He was brought thence to the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi>'s; and, from <hi>Ringwood</hi> ſent a Letter to the King, Proteſting <hi>the Remorſe in him, for the Wrong he had done His Majeſty in ſeveral things, and now in taking up Arms againſt him. He complained of his Misfortune, in meeting ſome Horrid People, that led him away to believe, That it was a ſhame and a ſin before</hi> God, <hi>not to do it. But, he would not trouble his</hi> Majeſty <hi>at preſent, with many things he could ſay for himſelf, that he was ſure would move his Compaſſion. The chief end of this Letter, being only to beg, That he might have the Happineſs, to ſpeak to his</hi> Majeſty, <hi>having that to ſay to him, that he hoped might give him a long and Happy Reign.</hi> He concluded, <hi>That he really thought himſelf the moſt in the Wrong that ever any Man was, and had from the Bottom of his Heart, an Abhorrence for thoſe that put him upon it, and for the Action it ſelf. Hoping, that</hi> God <hi>Almighty would ſtrike his</hi> Majeſty's <hi>Heart with Mercy and Compaſſion for him, as he had done his with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:97792:178"/>of what he had done. Finally, he hoped to live, to ſhew how Zealous he ſhould ever be for his</hi> Majeſty's <hi>Service. And, could he ſay but one word in this Letter, he would be convinced of it; but it was of that Conſequence, that he durſt not do it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beg'd once more, that he might ſpeak with him. For, then he would be convinced, he ſhould ever be his</hi> Majeſty's <hi>moſt humble and dutiful,</hi> Monmouth.</p>
                        <p>Being brought to the <hi>Tower,</hi> he did not long ſurvive his Misfortunes.<note place="margin">July. 14. 1685.</note> For, being <hi>Attainted</hi> of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> by An <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> he was beheaded, on a Scaffold for that purpoſe, erected on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi>
